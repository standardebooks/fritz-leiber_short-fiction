        <p class="illustrator">Illustrated by WOOD</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“Come</span> on, Gussy,” Fay prodded
          quietly, “quit stalking
          around like a neurotic bear and
          suggest something for my invention
          team to work on. I enjoy
          visiting you and Daisy, but I
          can’t stay aboveground all night.”</p>
        <p>“If being outside the shelters
          makes you nervous, don’t come
          around any more,” Gusterson
          told him, continuing to stalk.
          “Why doesn’t your invention
          team think of something to invent?
          Why don’t you? Hah!” In
          the “Hah!” lay triumphant condemnation
          of a whole way of life.</p>
        <p>“We do,” Fay responded imperturbably,
          “but a fresh viewpoint sometimes helps.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll say it does! Fay, you burglar,
          I’ll bet you’ve got twenty
          people like myself you milk for
          free ideas. First you irritate their
          bark and then you make the
          <a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a>rounds every so often to draw off
          the latex or the maple gloop.”</p>
        <p>Fay smiled. “It ought to please
          you that society still has a use
          for you outre inner-directed
          types. It takes something to make
          a junior executive stay aboveground
          after dark, when the missiles
          are on the prowl.”</p>
        <p>“Society can’t have much use
          for <ins title="use">us</ins> or it’d pay us something,”
          Gusterson sourly asserted, staring
          blankly at the tankless TV
          and kicking it lightly as he
          passed on.</p>
        <p>“No, you’re wrong about that,
          Gussy. Money’s not the key goad
          with you inner-directeds. I got
          that straight from our Motivations
          chief.”</p>
        <p>“Did he tell you what we
          should use instead to pay the grocer?
          A deep inner sense of
          achievement, maybe? Fay, why
          should I do any free thinking for
          Micro Systems?”</p>
        <p>“I’ll tell you why, Gussy. Simply
          because you get a kick out of
          insulting us with sardonic ideas.
          If we take one of them seriously,
          you think we’re degrading ourselves,
          and that pleases you even
          more. Like making someone
          laugh at a lousy pun.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> held still in his
          roaming and grinned. “That
          the reason, huh? I suppose my
          suggestions would have to be
          something in the line of ultra-subminiaturized
          computers,
          where one sinister fine-etched
          molecule does the work of three
          big bumbling brain cells?”</p>
        <p>“Not necessarily. Micro Systems
          is branching out. Wheel as
          free as a rogue star. But I’ll pass
          along to Promotion your one
          molecule-three brain cell sparkler.
          It’s a slight exaggeration,
          but it’s catchy.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll have my kids watch your
          ads to see if you use it and then
          I’ll sue the whole underworld.”
          Gusterson frowned as he resumed
          his stalking. He stared puzzledly
          at the antique TV. “How about
          inventing a plutonium termite?”
          he said suddenly. “It would get
          rid of those stockpiles that are
          worrying you moles to death.”</p>
        <p>Fay grimaced noncommittally
          and cocked his head.</p>
        <p>“Well, then, how about a
          beauty mask? How about that,
          hey? I don’t mean one to repair
          a woman’s complexion, but one
          she’d wear all the time that’d
          make her look like a 17-year-old
          sexpot. That’d end <em>her</em> worries.”</p>
        <p>“Hey, that’s for me,” Daisy
          called from the kitchen. “I’ll
          make Gusterson suffer. I’ll make
          him crawl around on his hands
          and knees begging my immature
          favors.”</p>
        <div class="image"><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>
        <img alt="A montage: A fellow holding a gun on a man; a man and a woman nearly kissing; a one-eyed robot tearing up paper." height="548" src="images/illo-1.jpg" width="400"/>
        </div>
        <p>“No, you won’t,” Gusterson
          called back. “You having a face
          like that would scare the kids.
          Better cancel that one, Fay. Half
          <a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>the adult race looking like Vina
          Vidarsson is too awful a
          thought.”</p>
        <p>“Yah, you’re just scared of
          making a million dollars,” Daisy
          jeered.</p>
        <p>“I sure am,” Gusterson said
          solemnly, scanning the fuzzy
          floor from one murky glass wall
          to the other, hesitating at the TV.
          “How about something homey
          now, like a flock of little prickly
          cylinders that roll around the
          floor collecting lint and flub?
          They’d work by electricity, or at
          a pinch cats could bat ’em
          around. Every so often they’d be
          automatically herded together
          and the lint cleaned off the
          bristles.”</p>
        <p>“No good,” Fay said. “There’s
          no lint underground and cats are
          <em>verboten</em>. And the aboveground
          market doesn’t amount to more
          moneywise than the state of
          Southern Illinois. Keep it
          grander, Gussy, and more impractical—you
          can’t sell people
          merely useful ideas.” From his
          hassock in the center of the room
          he looked uneasily around. “Say,
          did that violet tone in the glass
          come from the high Cleveland
          hydrogen bomb or is it just age
          and ultraviolet, like desert glass?”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“No</span>, somebody’s grandfather
          liked it that color,” Gusterson
          informed him with happy
          bitterness. “I like it too—the
          glass, I mean, not the tint. People
          who live in glass houses can see
          the stars—especially when
          there’s a window-washing streak
          in their germ-plasm.”</p>
        <p>“Gussy, why don’t you move
          underground?” Fay asked, his
          voice taking on a missionary
          note. “It’s a lot easier living in
          one room, believe me. You don’t
          have to tramp from room to room
          hunting things.”</p>
        <p>“I like the exercise,” Gusterson
          said stoutly.</p>
        <p>“But I bet Daisy’d prefer it
          underground. And your kids
          wouldn’t have to explain why
          their father lives like a Red Indian.
          Not to mention the safety
          factor and insurance savings and
          a crypt church within easy slidewalk
          distance. Incidentally, we
          see the stars all the time, better
          than you do—by repeater.”</p>
        <p>“Stars by repeater,” Gusterson
          murmured to the ceiling, pausing
          for God to comment. Then, “No,
          Fay, even if I could afford it—and
          stand it—I’m such a
          bad-luck Harry that just when
          I got us all safely stowed at
          the N minus 1 sublevel, the
          Soviets would discover an
          earthquake bomb that struck
          from below, and I’d have to follow
          everybody back to the treetops.
          <em>Hey! How about bubble
          homes in orbit around earth?</em>
          Micro Systems could subdivide
          the world’s most spacious suburb
          <a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>and all you moles could go ellipsing.
          Space is as safe as there is:
          no air, no shock waves. Free fall’s
          the ultimate in restfulness—great
          health benefits. Commute
          by rocket—or better yet stay
          home and do all your business by
          TV-telephone, or by waldo if it
          were that sort of thing. Even pet
          your girl by remote control—she
          in her bubble, you in yours,
          whizzing through vacuum. Oh,
          damn-damn-<em>damn</em>-<em>damn</em>-DAMN!”</p>
        <p>He was glaring at the blank
          screen of the TV, his big hands
          clenching and unclenching.</p>
        <p>“Don’t let Fay give you apoplexy—he’s
          not worth it,” Daisy
          said, sticking her trim head in
          from the kitchen, while Fay inquired
          anxiously, “Gussy, what’s
          the matter?”</p>
        <p>“Nothing, you worm!” Gusterson
          roared, “Except that an hour
          ago I forgot to tune in on the only
          TV program I’ve wanted to hear
          this year—<em>Finnegans Wake</em>
          scored for English, Gaelic and
          brogue. Oh, damn-<em>damn</em>-DAMN!”</p>
        <p>“Too bad,” Fay said lightly. “I
          didn’t know they were releasing
          it on flat TV too.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“Well</span>, they were! Some
          things are too damn big
          to keep completely underground.
          And I had to forget! I’m always
          doing it—I miss everything!
          Look here, you rat,” he blatted
          suddenly at Fay, shaking his
          finger under the latter’s chin, “I’ll
          tell you what you can have that
          ignorant team of yours invent.
          They can fix me up a mechanical
          secretary that I can feed orders
          into and that’ll remind me when
          the exact moment comes to listen
          to TV or phone somebody or
          mail in a story or write a letter
          or pick up a magazine or look at
          an eclipse or a new orbiting station
          or fetch the kids from school
          or buy Daisy a bunch of flowers
          or whatever it is. It’s got to be
          something that’s always with me,
          not something I have to go and
          consult or that I can get sick of
          and put down somewhere. And
          it’s got to remind me forcibly
          enough so that I take notice and
          don’t just shrug it aside, like I
          sometimes do even when Daisy
          reminds me of things. That’s
          what your stupid team can invent
          for me! If they do a good job, I’ll
          pay ’em as much as fifty dollars!”</p>
        <p>“That doesn’t sound like anything
          so very original to me,” Fay
          commented coolly, leaning back
          from the wagging finger. “I think
          all senior executives have something
          of that sort. At least, their
          secretary keeps some kind of
          file….”</p>
        <p>“I’m not looking for something
          with spiked falsies and nylons up
          to the neck,” interjected Gusterson,
          whose ideas about secretaries
          were a trifle lurid. “I just want a
          <a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a>mech reminder—that’s all!”</p>
        <p>“Well, I’ll keep the idea in
          mind,” Fay assured him, “along
          with the bubble homes and
          beauty masks. If we ever develop
          anything along those lines, I’ll
          let you know. If it’s a beauty
          mask, I’ll bring Daisy a pilot
          model—to use to scare strange
          kids.” He put his watch to his
          ear. “Good lord, I’m going to have
          to cut to make it underground before
          the main doors close. Just
          ten minutes to Second Curfew!
          ’By, Gus. ’By, Daze.”</p>
        <p>Two minutes later, living room
          lights out, they watched Fay’s
          foreshortened antlike figure scurrying
          across the balding ill-lit
          park toward the nearest escalator.</p>
        <p>Gusterson said, “Weird to
          think of that big bright space-poor
          glamor basement stretching
          around everywhere underneath.
          Did you remind Smitty to put a
          new bulb in the elevator?”</p>
        <p>“The Smiths moved out this
          morning,” Daisy said tonelessly.
          “They went underneath.”</p>
        <p>“Like cockroaches,” Gusterson
          said. “Cockroaches leavin’ a
          sinkin’ apartment building. Next
          the ghosts’ll be retreatin’ to the
          shelters.”</p>
        <p>“Anyhow, from now on we’re
          our own janitors,” Daisy said.</p>
        <p>He nodded. “Just leaves three
          families besides us loyal to this
          glass death trap. Not countin’
          ghosts.” He sighed. Then, “You
          like to move below, Daisy?” he
          asked softly, putting his arm
          lightly across her shoulders. “Get
          a woozy eyeful of the bright lights
          and all for a change? Be a rat for
          a while? Maybe we’re getting too
          old to be bats. I could scrounge
          me a company job and have a
          thinking closet all to myself and
          two secretaries with stainless
          steel breasts. Life’d be easier for
          you and a lot cleaner. And you’d
          sleep safer.”</p>
        <p>“That’s true,” she answered
          and paused. She ran her fingertip
          slowly across the murky glass, its
          violet tint barely perceptible
          against a cold dim light across
          the park. “But somehow,” she
          said, snaking her arm around his
          waist, “I don’t think I’d sleep
          happier—or one bit excited.”</p>
        <h2>II</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">Three</span> weeks later Fay, dropping
          in again, handed to Daisy
          the larger of the two rather small
          packages he was carrying.</p>
        <p>“It’s a so-called beauty mask,”
          he told her, “complete with wig,
          eyelashes, and wettable velvet
          lips. It even breathes—pinholed
          elastiskin with a static adherence-charge.
          But Micro Systems had
          nothing to do with it, thank God.
          Beauty Trix put it on the market
          ten days ago and it’s already
          started a teen-age craze. Some
          <a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>boys are wearing them too, and
          the police are yipping at Trix for
          encouraging transvestism with
          psychic repercussions.”</p>
        <p>“Didn’t I hear somewhere that
          Trix is a secret subsidiary of
          Micro?” Gusterson demanded,
          rearing up from his ancient electric
          typewriter. “No, you’re not
          stopping me writing, Fay—it’s
          the gut of evening. If I do any
          more I won’t have any juice to
          start with tomorrow. I got another
          of my insanity thrillers
          moving. A real id-teaser. In this
          one not only all the characters
          are crazy but the robot psychiatrist
          too.”</p>
        <p>“The vending machines are
          jumping with insanity novels,”
          Fay commented. “Odd they’re so
          popular.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson chortled. “The only
          way you outer-directed moles
          will accept individuality any
          more even in a fictional character,
          without your superegos getting
          seasick, is for them to be
          crazy. Hey, Daisy! Lemme see
          that beauty mask!”</p>
        <p>But his wife, backing out of
          the room, hugged the package to
          her bosom and solemnly shook
          her head.</p>
        <p>“A hell of a thing,” Gusterson
          complained, “not even to be able
          to see what my stolen ideas look
          like.”</p>
        <p>“I got a present for you too,”
          Fay said. “Something you might
          think of as a royalty on all the
          inventions someone thought of a
          little ahead of you. Fifty dollars
          by your own evaluation.” He held
          out the smaller package. “Your
          tickler.”</p>
        <p>“My <em>what?</em>” Gusterson demanded
          suspiciously.</p>
        <p>“Your tickler. The mech reminder
          you wanted. It turns out
          that the file a secretary keeps to
          remind her boss to do certain
          things at certain times is called
          a tickler file. So we named this
          a tickler. Here.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson still didn’t touch the
          package. “You mean you actually
          put your invention team to work
          on that nonsense?”</p>
        <p>“Well, what do you think?
          Don’t be scared of it. Here, I’ll
          show you.”</p>
        <p>As he unwrapped the package,
          Fay said, “It hasn’t been decided
          yet whether we’ll manufacture it
          commercially. If we do, I’ll put
          through a voucher for you—for
          ‘development consultation’ or
          something like that. Sorry no royalty’s
          possible. Davidson’s squad
          had started to work up the identical
          idea three years ago, but it
          got shelved. I found it on a snoop
          through the closets. There! Looks
          rich, doesn’t it?”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">On the</span> scarred black tabletop
          was a dully gleaming
          silvery object about the size and
          shape of a cupped hand with fingers
          <a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>merging. A tiny pellet on a
          short near-invisible wire led off
          from it. On the back was a punctured
          area suggesting the face of
          a microphone; there was also a
          window with a date and time in
          hours and minutes showing
          through and next to that four
          little buttons in a row. The concave
          underside of the silvery
          “hand” was smooth except for a
          central area where what looked
          like two little rollers came
          through.</p>
        <p>“It goes on your shoulder under
          your shirt,” Fay explained,
          “and you tuck the pellet in your
          ear. We might work up bone conduction
          on a commercial model.
          Inside is an ultra-slow fine-wire
          recorder holding a spool that
          runs for a week. The clock lets
          you go to any place on the 7-day
          wire and record a message. The
          buttons give you variable speed
          in going there, so you don’t waste
          too much time making a setting.
          There’s a knack in fingering them
          efficiently, but it’s easily acquired.”</p>
        <p>Fay picked up the tickler. “For
          instance, suppose there’s a TV
          show you want to catch tomorrow
          night at twenty-two hundred.”
          He touched the buttons.
          There was the faintest whirring.
          The clock face blurred briefly
          three times before showing the
          setting he’d mentioned. Then Fay
          spoke into the punctured area:
          “Turn on TV Channel Two, you
          big dummy!” He grinned over at
          Gusterson. “When you’ve got all
          your instructions to yourself
          loaded in, you synchronize with
          the present moment and let her
          roll. Fit it on your shoulder and
          forget it. Oh, yes, and it literally
          does tickle you every time it delivers
          an instruction. That’s what
          the little rollers are for. Believe
          me, you can’t ignore it. Come on,
          Gussy, take off your shirt and try
          it out. We’ll feed in some instructions
          for the next ten minutes so
          you get the feel of how it works.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t want to,” Gusterson
          said. “Not right now. I want to
          sniff around it first. My God, it’s
          small! Besides everything else it
          does, does it think?”</p>
        <p>“Don’t pretend to be an idiot,
          Gussy! You know very well that
          even with ultra-sub-micro nothing
          quite this small can possibly have
          enough elements to do any thinking.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson shrugged. “I don’t
          know about that. I think bugs
          think.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Fay</span> groaned faintly. “Bugs operate
          by instinct, Gussy,” he
          said. “A patterned routine. They
          do not scan situations and consequences
          and then make decisions.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t expect bugs to make
          decisions,” Gusterson said. “For
          that matter I don’t like people
          <a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a>who go around alla time making
          decisions.”</p>
        <p>“Well, you can take it from me,
          Gussy, that this tickler is just a
          miniaturized wire recorder and
          clock … and a tickler. It doesn’t
          do anything else.”</p>
        <p>“Not yet, maybe,” Gusterson
          said darkly. “Not this model. Fay,
          I’m serious about bugs thinking.
          Or if they don’t exactly think,
          they feel. They’ve got an interior
          drama. An inner glow. They’re
          conscious. For that matter, Fay,
          I think all your really complex
          electronic computers are conscious
          too.”</p>
        <p>“Quit kidding, Gussy.”</p>
        <p>“Who’s kidding?”</p>
        <p>“You are. Computers simply
          aren’t alive.”</p>
        <p>“What’s alive? A word. I think
          computers are conscious, at least
          while they’re operating. They’ve
          got that inner glow of awareness.
          They sort of … well … meditate.”</p>
        <p>“Gussy, computers haven’t got
          any circuits for meditating.
          They’re not programmed for
          mystical lucubrations. They’ve
          just got circuits for solving the
          problems they’re on.”</p>
        <p>“Okay, you admit they’ve got
          problem-solving circuits—like
          a man has. I say if they’ve got the
          equipment for being conscious,
          they’re conscious. What has
          wings, flies.”</p>
        <p>“Including stuffed owls and
          gilt eagles and dodoes—and
          wood-burning airplanes?”</p>
        <p>“Maybe, under some circumstances.
          There <em>was</em> a wood-burning
          airplane. Fay,” Gusterson
          continued, wagging his wrists for
          emphasis, “I really think computers
          are conscious. They just don’t
          have any way of telling us that
          they are. Or maybe they don’t
          have any <em>reason</em> to tell us, like
          the little Scotch boy who didn’t
          say a word until he was fifteen
          and was supposed to be deaf and
          dumb.”</p>
        <p>“Why didn’t he say a word?”</p>
        <p>“Because he’d never had anything
          to say. Or take those Hindu
          fakirs, Fay, who sit still and don’t
          say a word for thirty years or
          until their fingernails grow to the
          next village. If Hindu fakirs can
          do that, computers can!”</p>
        <p>Looking as if he were masticating
          a lemon, Fay asked quietly,
          “Gussy, did you say you’re working
          on an insanity novel?”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> frowned fiercely.
          “Now you’re kidding,” he accused
          Fay. “The dirty kind of
          kidding, too.”</p>
        <p>“I’m sorry,” Fay said with light
          contrition. “Well, now you’ve
          sniffed at it, how about trying on
          Tickler?” He picked up the
          gleaming blunted crescent and
          jogged it temptingly under Gusterson’s
          chin.</p>
        <p>“Why should I?” Gusterson
          <a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>asked, stepping back. “Fay, I’m
          up to my ears writing a book. The
          last thing I want is something interrupting
          me to make me listen
          to a lot of junk and do a lot of
          useless things.”</p>
        <p>“But, dammit, Gussy! It was
          all your idea in the first place!”
          Fay blatted. Then, catching himself,
          he added, “I mean, you were
          one of the first people to think of
          this particular sort of instrument.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe so, but I’ve done some
          more thinking since then.” Gusterson’s
          voice grew a trifle solemn.
          “Inner-directed worthwhile thinkin’.
          Fay, when a man forgets to
          do something, it’s because he
          really doesn’t want to do it or
          because he’s all roiled up down
          in his unconscious. He ought to
          take it as a danger signal and
          investigate the roiling, not hire
          himself a human or mech reminder.”</p>
        <p>“Bushwa,” Fay retorted. “In
          that case you shouldn’t write
          memorandums or even take
          notes.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe I shouldn’t,” Gusterson
          agreed lamely. “I’d have to
          think that over too.”</p>
        <p>“Ha!” Fay jeered. “No, I’ll tell
          you what your trouble is, Gussy.
          You’re simply scared of this contraption.
          You’ve loaded your
          skull with horror-story nonsense
          about machines sprouting minds
          and taking over the world—until
          you’re even scared of a simple
          miniaturized and clocked recorder.”
          He thrust it out.</p>
        <p>“Maybe I am,” Gusterson admitted,
          controlling a flinch. “Honestly,
          Fay, that thing’s got a
          gleam in its eye as if it had ideas
          of its own. Nasty ideas.”</p>
        <p>“Gussy, you nut, it hasn’t <em>got</em>
          an eye.”</p>
        <p>“Not now, no, but it’s got the
          gleam—the eye may come. It’s
          the <ins title="Chesire">Cheshire</ins> cat in reverse. If
          you’d step over here and look at
          yourself holding it, you could see
          what I mean. But I don’t think
          computers <em>sprout</em> minds, Fay. I
          just think they’ve <em>got</em> minds, because
          they’ve got the mind elements.”</p>
        <p>“Ho, ho!” Fay mocked. “Everything
          that has a material side has
          a mental side,” he chanted.
          “Everything that’s a body is also
          a spirit. Gussy, that dubious old
          metaphysical dualism went out
          centuries ago.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe so,” Gusterson said,
          “but we still haven’t anything but
          that dubious dualism to explain
          the human mind, have we? It’s a
          jelly of nerve cells and it’s a
          vision of the cosmos. If that isn’t
          dualism, what is?”</p>
        <p>“I give up. Gussy, are you going
          to try out this tickler?”</p>
        <p>“No!”</p>
        <p>“But dammit, Gussy, we made
          it just for you!—practically.”</p>
        <p>“Sorry, but I’m not coming
          near the thing.”</p>
        <p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>“<ins title="’Zen">Zen</ins> come near me,” a husky
          voice intoned behind them. “Tonight
          I vant a man.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Standing</span> in the door was
          something slim in a short
          silver sheath. It had golden bangs
          and the haughtiest snub-nosed
          face in the world. It slunk toward
          them.</p>
        <p>“My God, Vina Vidarsson!”
          Gusterson yelled.</p>
        <p>“Daisy, that’s terrific,” Fay applauded,
          going up to her.</p>
        <p>She bumped him aside with a
          swing of her hips, continuing to
          advance. “Not you, Ratty,” she
          said throatily. “I vant a real
          man.”</p>
        <p>“Fay, I suggested Vina Vidarsson’s
          face for the beauty mask,”
          Gusterson said, walking around
          his wife and shaking a finger.
          “Don’t tell me Trix just happened
          to think of that too.”</p>
        <p>“What else could they think
          of?” Fay laughed. “This season
          sex means VV and nobody else.”
          An odd little grin flicked his lips,
          a tic traveled up his face and his
          body twitched slightly. “Say, folks,
          I’m going to have to be leaving.
          It’s exactly fifteen minutes to
          Second Curfew. Last time I had
          to run and I got heartburn. When
          <em>are</em> you people going to move
          downstairs? I’ll leave Tickler,
          Gussy. Play around with it and
          get used to it. ’By now.”</p>
        <p>“Hey, Fay,” Gusterson called
          curiously, “have you developed
          absolute time sense?”</p>
        <p>Fay grinned a big grin from
          the doorway—almost too big a
          grin for so small a man. “I didn’t
          need to,” he said softly, patting
          his right shoulder. “My tickler
          told me.”</p>
        <p>He closed the door behind him.</p>
        <p>As side-by-side they watched
          him strut sedately across the
          murky chilly-looking park, Gusterson
          mused, “So the little devil
          had one of those nonsense-gadgets
          on all the time and I never noticed.
          Can you beat that?” Something
          drew across the violet-tinged
          stars a short bright line that
          quickly faded. “What’s that?”
          Gusterson asked gloomily. “Next
          to last stage of missile-here?”</p>
        <p>“Won’t you settle for an old-fashioned
          shooting star?” Daisy
          asked softly. The (wettable) velvet
          lips of the mask made even
          her natural voice sound different.
          She reached a hand back of her
          neck to pull the thing off.</p>
        <p>“Hey, don’t do that,” Gusterson
          protested in a hurt voice.
          “Not for a while anyway.”</p>
        <p>“Hokay!” she said harshly,
          turning on him. “Zen down on
          your knees, dog!”</p>
        <h2>III</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">It was</span> a fortnight and Gusterson
          was loping down the home
          stretch on his 40,000-word insanity
          <a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>novel before Fay dropped
          in again, this time promptly at
          high noon.</p>
        <p>Normally Fay cringed his
          shoulders a trifle and was inclined
          to slither, but now he
          strode aggressively, his legs scissoring
          in a fast, low goosestep. He
          whipped off the sunglasses that
          all moles wore topside by day
          and began to pound Gusterson on
          the back while calling boisterously,
          “How are you, Gussy Old
          Boy, Old Boy?”</p>
        <p>Daisy came in from the kitchen
          to see why Gusterson was
          choking. She was instantly grabbed
          and violently bussed to the
          accompaniment of, “Hiya, Gorgeous!
          Yum-yum! How about ad-libbing
          that some weekend?”</p>
        <p>She stared at Fay dazedly,
          rasping the back of her hand
          across her mouth, while Gusterson
          yelled, “Quit that! What’s got
          into you, Fay? Have they transferred
          you out of R &amp; D to Company
          Morale? Do they line up
          all the secretaries at roll call and
          make you give them an eight-hour
          energizing kiss?”</p>
        <p>“Ha, wouldn’t you like to
          know?<ins class="close quote missing">”</ins> Fay retorted. He grinned,
          twitched jumpingly, held still a
          moment, then hustled over to the
          far wall. “Look out there,” he
          rapped, pointing through the violet
          glass at a gap between the two
          nearest old skyscraper apartments.
          “In thirty seconds you’ll
          see them test the new needle
          bomb at the other end of Lake
          Erie. It’s educational.” He began
          to count off seconds, vigorously
          semaphoring his arm. “… Two
          … three … Gussy, I’ve put
          through a voucher for two yards
          for you. Budgeting squawked, but
          I pressured ’em.”</p>
        <p>Daisy squealed, “Yards!—are
          those dollar thousands?” while
          Gusterson was asking, “Then
          you’re marketing the tickler?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. Yes,” Fay replied to
          them in turn. “… Nine …
          ten …” Again he grinned and
          twitched. “Time for noon Com-staff,”
          he announced staccato.
          “Pardon the hush box.” He
          whipped a pancake phone from
          under his coat, clapped it over his
          face and spoke fiercely but inaudibly
          into it, continuing to semaphore.
          Suddenly he thrust the
          phone away. “Twenty-nine …
          thirty … Thar she blows!”</p>
        <p>An incandescent streak shot up
          the sky from a little above the
          far horizon and a doubly dazzling
          point of light appeared just above
          the top of it, with the effect of
          God dotting an “i”.</p>
        <p>“Ha, that’ll skewer espionage
          satellites like swatting flies!” Fay
          proclaimed as the portent faded.
          “Bracing! Gussy, where’s your
          tickler? I’ve got a new spool for
          it that’ll razzle-dazzle you.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll bet,” Gusterson said drily.
          “Daisy?”</p>
        <p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a>“You gave it to the kids and
          they got to fooling with it and
          broke it.”</p>
        <p>“No matter,” Fay told them
          with a large sidewise sweep of
          his hand. “Better you wait for the
          new model. It’s a six-way improvement.”</p>
        <p>“So I gather,” Gusterson said,
          eyeing him speculatively. “Does
          it automatically inject you with
          cocaine? A fix every hour on the
          second?”</p>
        <p>“Ha-ha, joke. Gussy, it achieves
          the same effect without using any
          dope at all. Listen: a tickler reminds
          you of your duties and opportunities—your
          chances for
          happiness and success! What’s
          the obvious next step?”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“Throw</span> it out the window.
          By the way, how do you do
          that when you’re underground?”</p>
        <p>“We have hi-speed garbage
          boosts. The obvious next step is
          you give the tickler a heart. It
          not only tells you, it warmly persuades
          you. It doesn’t just say,
          ‘Turn on the TV Channel Two,
          Joyce program,’ it <em>brills</em> at you,
          ‘Kid, Old Kid, race for the TV
          and flip that Two Switch! There’s
          a great show coming through the
          pipes this second plus ten—you’ll
          enjoy the hell out of yourself!
          Grab a ticket to <ins title="ecstacy">ecstasy</ins>!’”</p>
        <p>“My God,” Gusterson gasped,
          “are those the kind of jolts it’s
          giving you now?”</p>
        <p>“Don’t you get it, Gussy? You
          never load your tickler except
          when you’re feeling buoyantly
          enthusiastic. You don’t just tell
          yourself what to do hour by hour
          next week, you sell yourself on
          it. That way you not only make
          doubly sure you’ll obey instructions
          but you constantly reinoculate
          yourself with your own enthusiasm.”</p>
        <p>“I can’t stand myself when I’m
          that enthusiastic,” Gusterson said.
          “I feel ashamed for hours afterwards.”</p>
        <p>“You’re warped—all this
          lonely sky-life. What’s more,
          Gussy, think how still more persuasive
          some of those instructions
          would be if they came to a man
          in his best girl’s most bedroomy
          voice, or his doctor’s or psycher’s
          if it’s that sort of thing—or
          Vina Vidarsson’s! By the way,
          Daze, don’t wear that beauty
          mask outside. It’s a grand misdemeanor
          ever since ten thousand
          teen-agers rioted through
          Tunnel-Mart wearing them. And
          VV’s sueing Trix.”</p>
        <p>“No chance of that,” Daisy said.
          “Gusterson got excited and bit
          off the nose.” She pinched her
          own delicately.</p>
        <p>“I’d no more obey my enthusiastic
          self,” Gusterson was brooding,
          “than I’d obey a Napoleon
          drunk on his own brandy or a
          hopped-up St. Francis. Reinoculated
          with my own enthusiasm?
          <a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>I’d die just like from snake-bite!”</p>
        <p>“Warped, I said,” Fay dogmatized,
          stamping around. “Gussy,
          having the instructions persuasive
          instead of neutral turned out
          to be only the opening wedge.
          The next step wasn’t so obvious,
          but I saw it. Using subliminal
          verbal stimuli in his tickler, a
          man can be given constant supportive
          euphoric therapy 24
          hours a day! And it makes use
          of all that empty wire. We’ve revived
          the ideas of a pioneer dynamic
          psycher named Dr. Coué.
          For instance, right now my tickler
          is saying to me—in tones too
          soft to reach my conscious mind,
          but do they stab into the unconscious!—‘Day
          by day in every
          way I’m getting sharper and
          sharper.’ It alternates that with
          ‘gutsier and gutsier’ and … well,
          forget that. Coué mostly used
          ‘better and better’ but that seems
          too general. And every hundredth
          time it says them out loud
          and the tickler <ins title="give">gives</ins> me a brush—just
          a faint cootch—to make
          sure I’m keeping in touch.”</p>
        <p>“That third word-pair,” Daisy
          wondered, feeling her mouth
          reminiscently. “Could I guess?”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson’s</span> eyes had been
          growing wider and wider.
          “Fay,” he said, “I could no more
          use my mind for anything if I
          knew all that was going on in my
          inner ear than if I were being
          brushed down with brooms by
          three witches. Look here,” he said
          with loud authority, “you got to
          stop all this—it’s crazy. Fay, if
          Micro’ll junk the tickler, I’ll
          think you up something else to
          invent—something real good.”</p>
        <p>“Your inventing days are
          over,” Fay brilled gleefully. “I
          mean, you’ll never equal your
          masterpiece.”</p>
        <p>“How about,” Gusterson bellowed,
          “an anti-individual guided
          missile? The physicists have got
          small-scale antigravity good
          enough to float and fly something
          the size of a hand grenade.
          I can smell that even though it’s
          a back-of-the-safe military secret.
          Well, how about keying such a
          missile to a man’s finger-prints—or
          brainwaves, maybe, or his
          unique smell!—so it can spot
          and follow him around <ins title="the">then</ins> target
          in on him, without harming anyone
          else? Long-distance assassination—and
          the stinkingest gets
          it! Or you could simply load it
          with some disgusting goo and key
          it to teen-agers as a group—that’d
          take care of them. Fay,
          doesn’t it give you a rich warm
          kick to think of my midget missiles
          buzzing around in your tunnels,
          seeking out evil-doers, like
          a swarm of angry wasps or angelic
          bumblebees?”</p>
        <p>“You’re not luring me down
          any side trails,” Fay said laughingly.
          He grinned and twitched,
          <a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>then hurried toward the opposite
          wall, motioning them to follow.
          Outside, about a hundred yards
          beyond the purple glass, rose another
          ancient glass-walled apartment
          skyscraper. Beyond, Lake
          Erie rippled glintingly.</p>
        <p>“Another bomb-test?” Gusterson
          asked.</p>
        <p>Fay pointed at the building.
          “Tomorrow,” he announced, “a
          modern factory, devoted solely to
          the manufacture of ticklers, will
          be erected on that site.”</p>
        <p>“You mean one of those windowless
          phallic eyesores?” Gusterson
          demanded. “Fay, you people
          aren’t even consistent. You’ve
          got all your homes underground.
          Why not your factories?”</p>
        <p>“Sh! Not enough room. And
          night missiles are scarier.”</p>
        <p>“I know that building’s been
          empty for a year,” Daisy said uneasily,
          “but how—?”</p>
        <p>“Sh! Watch! <em>Now!</em>”</p>
        <p>The looming building seemed
          to blur or fuzz for a moment.
          Then it was as if the lake’s bright
          ripples had invaded the old glass
          a hundred yards away. Wavelets
          chased themselves up and down
          the gleaming walls, became higher,
          higher … and then suddenly
          the glass cracked all over to tiny
          fragments and fell away, to be
          followed quickly by fragmented
          concrete and plastic and plastic
          piping, until all that was left was
          the nude steel framework, vibrating
          so rapidly as to be almost invisible
          against the gleaming lake.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Daisy covered</span> her ears,
          but there was no explosion,
          only a long-drawn-out low crash
          as the fragments hit twenty floors
          below and dust whooshed out
          sideways.</p>
        <p>“Spectacular!” Fay summed
          up. “Knew you’d enjoy it. That
          little trick was first conceived by
          the great Tesla during his last
          fruity years. Research discovered
          it in his biog—we just made the
          dream come true. A tiny resonance
          device you could carry in
          your belt-bag attunes itself to the
          natural harmonic of a structure
          and then increases amplitude by
          tiny pushes exactly in time. Just
          like soldiers marching in step can
          break down a bridge, only this is
          as if it were being done by one
          marching ant.” He pointed at the
          naked framework appearing out
          of its own blur and said, “We’ll
          be able to hang the factory on
          that. If not, we’ll whip a mega-current
          through it and vaporize
          it. No question the micro-resonator
          is the neatest sweetest wrecking
          device going. You can expect
          a lot more of this sort of efficiency
          now that mankind has the
          tickler to enable him to use his
          full potential. What’s the matter,
          folks?”</p>
        <p>Daisy was staring around the
          violet-walled room with dumb
          <a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>mistrust. Her hands were trembling.</p>
        <p>“You don’t have to worry,”
          Fay assured her with an understanding
          laugh. “This building’s
          safe for a month more at least.”
          Suddenly he grimaced and
          leaped a foot in the air. He raised
          a clawed hand to scratch his
          shoulder but managed to check
          the movement. “Got to beat it,
          folks,” he announced tersely. “My
          tickler gave me the grand
          cootch.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t go yet,” Gusterson
          called, rousing himself with a
          shudder which he immediately
          explained: “I just had the illusion
          that if I shook myself all my
          flesh and guts would fall off my
          shimmying skeleton, Brr! Fay,
          before you and Micro go off half
          cocked, I want you to know
          there’s one insuperable objection
          to the tickler as a mass-market
          item. The average man or woman
          won’t go to the considerable time
          and trouble it must take to load
          a tickler. He simply hasn’t got
          the compulsive orderliness and
          willingness to plan that it requires.”</p>
        <p>“We thought of that weeks
          ago,” Fay rapped, his hand on the
          door. “Every tickler spool that
          goes to market is patterned like
          wallpaper with one of five designs
          of suitable subliminal supportive
          euphoric material. ‘Ittier
          and ittier,’ ‘viriler and viriler’—you
          know. The buyer is robot-interviewed
          for an hour, his personalized
          daily routine laid out
          and thereafter templated on his
          weekly spool. He’s strongly urged
          next to take his tickler to his doctor
          and psycher for further instruction-imposition.
          We’ve been
          working with the medical profession
          from the start. They love
          the tickler because it’ll remind
          people to take their medicine on
          the dot … and rest and eat and
          go to sleep just when and how
          doc says. This is a big operation,
          Gussy—a biiiiiiig operation! ’By!”</p>
        <p>Daisy hurried to the wall to
          watch him cross the park. Deep
          down she was a wee bit worried
          that he might linger to attach a
          micro-resonator to <em>this</em> building
          and she wanted to time him. But
          Gusterson settled down to his
          typewriter and began to bat
          away.</p>
        <p>“I want to have another novel
          started,” he explained to her, “before
          the ant marches across this
          building in about four and a half
          weeks … or a million sharp little
          gutsy guys come swarming
          out of the ground and heave it
          into Lake Erie.”</p>
        <h2>IV</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">Early next</span> morning windowless
          walls began to crawl
          up the stripped skyscraper between
          them and the lake. Daisy
          <a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"></a>pulled the black-out curtains on
          that side. For a day or two longer
          their thoughts and conversations
          were haunted by Gusterson’s
          vague sardonic visions of a horde
          of tickler-energized moles pouring
          up out of the tunnels to tear
          down the remaining trees, tank
          the atmosphere and perhaps
          somehow dismantle the stars—at
          least on this side of the world—but
          then they both settled
          back into their customary easy-going
          routines. Gusterson typed.
          Daisy made her daily shopping
          trip to a little topside daytime
          store and started painting a mural
          on the floor of the empty
          apartment next theirs but one.</p>
        <p>“We ought to lasso some neighbors,”
          she suggested once. “I need
          somebody to hold my brushes
          and admire. How about you making
          a trip below at the cocktail
          hours, Gusterson, and picking up
          a couple of girls for a starter?
          Flash the old viriler charm,
          cootch them up a bit, emphasize
          the delights of high living, but
          make sure they’re compatible
          roommates. You could pick up
          that two-yard check from Micro
          at the same time.”</p>
        <p>“You’re an immoral money-ravenous
          wench,” Gusterson said
          absently, trying to dream of an
          insanity beyond insanity that
          would make his next novel a real
          id-rousing best-vender.</p>
        <p>“If that’s your vision of me,
          you shouldn’t have chewed up
          the VV mask.”</p>
        <p>“I’d really prefer you with
          green stripes,” he told her. “But
          stripes, spots, or sun-bathing,
          you’re better than those cocktail
          moles.”</p>
        <p>Actually both of them acutely
          disliked going below. They much
          preferred to perch in their eyrie
          and watch the people of Cleveland
          Depths, as they privately
          called the local sub-suburb, rush
          up out of the shelters at dawn to
          work in the concrete fields and
          windowless factories, make their
          daytime jet trips and freeway
          jaunts, do their noon-hour and
          coffee-break guerrilla practice,
          and then go scurrying back at
          twilight to the atomic-proof,
          brightly lit, vastly exciting, claustrophobic
          caves.</p>
        <p>Fay and his projects began
          once more to seem dreamlike,
          though Gusterson did run across
          a cryptic advertisement for ticklers
          in <em>The Manchester Guardian</em>,
          which he got daily by facsimile.
          Their three children reported
          similar ads, of no interest
          to young fry, on the TV and one
          afternoon they came home with
          the startling news that the monitors
          at their subsurface school
          had been issued ticklers. On
          sharp interrogation by Gusterson,
          however, it appeared that
          these last were not ticklers but
          merely two-way radios linked to
          <a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>the school police station transmitter.</p>
        <div class="image">
        <img alt="A man looks at another man who has a small electronic device on his shoulder and a wire going into his ear." height="274" src="images/illo-2.jpg" width="400"/>
        </div>
        <p>“Which is bad enough,” Gusterson
          commented later to Daisy.
          “But it’d be even dirtier to think
          of those clock-watching superegos
          being strapped to kids’
          shoulders. Can you imagine Huck
          Finn with a tickler, tellin’ him
          when to tie up the raft to a tow-head
          and when to take a swim?”</p>
        <p>“I bet Fay could,” Daisy
          countered. “When’s he going to
          bring you that check, anyhow?
          Iago wants a jetcycle and I
          promised Imogene a Vina Kit
          and then Claudius’ll have to have
          something.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson scowled thoughtfully.
          “You know, Daze,” he said,
          “I got a feeling Fay’s in the hospital,
          all narcotized up and being
          fed intravenously. The way he
          was jumping around last time,
          that tickler was going to cootch
          him to pieces in a week.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">As if to</span> refute this intuition,
          Fay turned up that very
          evening. The lights were dim.
          Something had gone wrong with
          the building’s old transformer
          and, pending repairs, the two remaining
          occupied apartments
          were making do with batteries,
          which turned bright globes to
          mysterious amber candles and
          made Gusterson’s ancient typewriter
          operate sluggishly.</p>
        <p>Fay’s manner was subdued or
          <a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"></a>at least closely controlled and
          for a moment Gusterson thought
          he’d shed his tickler. Then the
          little man came out of the shadows
          and Gusterson saw the large
          bulge on his right shoulder.</p>

        <p>“Yes, we had to up it a bit
          sizewise,” Fay explained in
          clipped tones. “Additional super-features.
          While brilliantly successful
          on the whole, the subliminal
          euphorics were a shade
          too effective. Several hundred
          users went hoppity manic. We
          gentled the cootch and qualified
          the subliminals—you know,
          ‘Day by day in every way I’m
          getting sharper <em>and more serene</em>’—but
          a stabilizing influence was
          still needed, so after a top-level
          conference we decided to combine
          Tickler with Moodmaster.”</p>
        <p>“My God,” Gusterson interjected,
          “do they have a machine
          now that does that?”</p>
        <p>“Of course. They’ve been using
          them on ex-mental patients for
          years.”</p>
        <p>“I just don’t keep up with
          progress,” Gusterson said, shaking
          his head bleakly. “I’m falling
          behind on all fronts.”</p>
        <p>“You ought to have your tickler
          remind you to read Science
          Service releases,” Fay told him.
          “Or simply instruct it to scan the
          releases and—no, that’s still in
          research.” He looked at Gusterson’s
          shoulder and his eyes widened.
          “You’re not wearing the
          <a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>new-model tickler I sent you,”
          he said accusingly.</p>
        <p>“I never got it,” Gusterson assured
          him. “Postmen deliver
          <ins title="top-side">topside</ins> mail and parcels by
          throwing them on the high-speed
          garbage boosts and hoping a tornado
          will blow them to the right
          addresses.” Then he added helpfully,
          “Maybe the Russians stole
          it while it was riding the whirlwinds.”</p>
        <p>“That’s not a suitable topic for
          jesting,” Fay frowned. “We’re
          hoping that Tickler will mobilize
          the full potential of the Free
          World for the first time in history.
          Gusterson, you are going to
          have to wear a ticky-tick. It’s becoming
          impossible for a man to
          get through modern life without
          one.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe I will,” Gusterson said
          appeasingly, “but right now tell
          me about Moodmaster. I want to
          put it in my new insanity novel.”</p>
        <p>Fay shook his head. “Your
          readers will just think you’re behind
          the times. If you use it,
          underplay it. But anyhow, Moodmaster
          is a simple physiotherapy
          engine that monitors bloodstream
          chemicals and body electricity. It
          ties directly into the bloodstream,
          keeping blood, sugar, et
          cetera, at optimum levels and injecting
          euphrin or depressin as
          necessary—and occasionally a
          touch of extra adrenaline, as during
          work emergencies.”</p>
        <p>“Is it painful?” Daisy called
          from the bedroom.</p>
        <p>“Excruciating,” Gusterson called
          back. “Excuse it, please,” he
          grinned at Fay. “Hey, didn’t I
          suggest cocaine injections last
          time I saw you?”</p>
        <p>“So you did,” Fay agreed flatly.
          “Oh by the way, Gussy, here’s
          that check for a yard I promised
          you. Micro doesn’t muzzle the
          ox.”</p>
        <p>“Hooray!” Daisy cheered faintly.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“I thought</span> you said it was
          going to be for two.” Gusterson
          complained.</p>
        <p>“Budgeting always forces a
          last-minute compromise,” Fay
          shrugged. “You have to learn to
          accept those things.”</p>
        <p>“I love accepting money and
          I’m glad any time for three feet,”
          Daisy called agreeably. “Six feet
          might make me wonder if I
          weren’t an insect, but getting a
          yard just makes me feel like a
          gangster’s moll.”</p>
        <p>“Want to come out and gloat
          over the yard paper, Toots, and
          stuff it in your diamond-embroidered
          net stocking top?” Gusterson
          called back.</p>
        <p>“No, I’m doing something to
          that portion of me just now. But
          hang onto the yard, Gusterson.”</p>
        <p>“Aye-aye, Cap’n,” he assured
          her. Then, turning back to Fay,
          “So you’ve taken the Dr. Coué
          <a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>repeating out of the tickler?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Just balanced it off
          with depressin. The subliminals
          are still a prime sales-point. All
          the tickler features are cumulative,
          Gussy. You’re still underestimating
          the scope of the device.”</p>
        <p>“I guess I am. What’s this
          ‘work-emergencies’ business? If
          you’re using the tickler to inject
          drugs into workers to keep them
          going, that’s really just my cocaine
          suggestion modernized and
          I’m putting in for another thou.
          Hundreds of years ago the South
          American Indians chewed coca
          leaves to kill fatigue sensations.”</p>
        <p>“That so? Interesting—and
          it proves priority for the Indians,
          doesn’t it? I’ll make a try for you,
          Gussy, but don’t expect anything.”
          He cleared his throat, his
          eyes grew distant and, turning
          his head a little to the right, he
          enunciated sharply, “Pooh-Bah.
          Time: Inst oh five. One oh five
          seven. Oh oh. Record: Gussy
          coca thou budget. Cut.” He explained,
          “We got a voice-cued
          setter now on the deluxe models.
          You can record a memo to yourself
          without taking off your shirt.
          Incidentally, I use the ends of the
          hours for trifle-memos. I’ve already
          used up the fifty-nines and
          eights for tomorrow and started
          on the fifty-sevens.”</p>
        <p>“I understood most of your
          memo,” Gusterson told him gruffly.
          “The last ‘Oh oh’ was for seconds,
          wasn’t it? Now I call that
          crude—why not microseconds
          too? But how do you remember
          where you’ve made a memo so
          you don’t rerecord over it? After
          all, you’re rerecording over the
          wallpaper all the time.”</p>
        <p>“Tickler beeps and then hunts
          for the nearest information-free
          space.”</p>
        <p>“I see. And what’s the Pooh-Bah
          for?”</p>
        <p>Fay smiled. “Cut. My password
          for activating the setter, so
          it won’t respond to chance numerals
          it overhears.”</p>
        <p>“But why Pooh-Bah?”</p>
        <p>Fay grinned. “Cut. And you a
          writer. It’s a literary reference,
          Gussy. Pooh-Bah (cut!) was
          Lord High Everything Else in
          <em>The Mikado</em>. He had a little list
          and nothing on it would ever be
          missed.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“Oh, yeah</span>,” Gusterson remembered,
          glowering. “As
          I recall it, all that went on that
          list was the names of people who
          were slated to have their heads
          chopped off by Ko-Ko. Better
          watch your step, Shorty. It may
          be a back-handed omen. Maybe
          all those workers you’re puttin’
          ticklers on to pump them full of
          adrenaline so they’ll overwork
          without noticin’ it will revolt and
          come out some day choppin’ for
          your head.”</p>
        <p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>“Spare me the Marxist mythology,”
          Fay protested. “Gussy,
          you’ve got a completely wrong
          slant on Tickler. It’s true that
          most of our mass sales so far, bar
          government and army, have been
          to large companies purchasing
          for their employees—”</p>
        <p>“Ah-ha!”</p>
        <p>“—but that’s because there’s
          nothing like a tickler for teaching
          a new man his job. It tells
          him from instant to instant what
          he must do—while he’s already
          on the job and without disturbing
          other workers. Magnetizing a
          wire with a job pattern is the
          easiest thing going. And you’d be
          astonished what the subliminals
          do for employee morale. It’s this
          way, Gussy: most people are too
          improvident and unimaginative
          to see in advance the advantages
          of ticklers. They buy one because
          the company strongly suggests it
          and payment is on easy installments
          withheld from salary.
          They find a tickler makes the
          work day go easier. The little fellow
          perched on your shoulder is
          a friend exuding comfort and
          good advice. The first thing he’s
          set to say is ‘Take it easy, pal.’</p>
        <p>“Within a week they’re wearing
          their tickler 24 hours a day—and
          buying a tickler for the
          wife, so she’ll remember to comb
          her hair and smile real pretty
          and cook favorite dishes.”</p>
        <p>“I get it, Fay,” Gusterson cut
          in. “The tickler is the newest fad
          for increasing worker efficiency.
          Once, I read somewheres, it was
          salt tablets. They had salt-tablet
          dispensers everywhere, even in
          air-conditioned offices where
          there wasn’t a moist armpit twice
          a year and the gals sweat only
          champagne. A decade later people
          wondered what all those
          dusty white pills were for. Sometimes
          they were mistook for tranquilizers.
          It’ll be the same way
          with ticklers. Somebody’ll open
          a musty closet and see jumbled
          heaps of these gripping-hand silvery
          gadgets gathering dust curls
          and—”</p>
        <p>“They will not!” Fay protested
          vehemently. “Ticklers are not a
          fad—they’re history-changers,
          they’re Free-World revolutionary!
          Why, before Micro Systems
          put a single one on the market,
          we’d made it a rule that every
          Micro employee had to wear one!
          If that’s not having supreme confidence
          in a product—”</p>
        <p>“Every employee except the
          top executives, of course,” Gusterson
          interrupted jeeringly. “And
          that’s not demoting you, Fay.
          As the R &amp; D chief most closely
          involved, you’d naturally have to
          show special enthusiasm.”</p>
        <p>“But you’re wrong there, Gussy,”
          Fay crowed. “Man for man,
          our top executives have been
          more enthusiastic about their
          personal ticklers than any other
          <a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"></a>class of worker in the whole outfit.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson slumped and shook
          his head. “If that’s the case,” he
          said darkly, “maybe mankind deserves
          the tickler.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“I’ll say it</span> does!” Fay
          agreed loudly without
          thinking. Then, “Oh, can the
          carping, Gussy. Tickler’s a great
          invention. Don’t deprecate it just
          because you had something to do
          with its genesis. You’re going to
          have to get in the swim and wear
          one.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe I’d rather drown horribly.”</p>
        <p>“Can the gloom-talk too! Gussy,
          I said it before and I say it
          again, you’re just scared of this
          new thing. Why, you’ve even got
          the drapes pulled so you won’t
          have to look at the tickler factory.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I am scared,” Gusterson
          said. “Really sca … AWP!”</p>
        <p>Fay whirled around. Daisy was
          standing in the bedroom doorway,
          wearing the short silver
          sheath. This time there was no
          mask, but her bobbed hair was
          glitteringly silvered, while her
          legs, arms, hands, neck, face—every
          bit of her exposed skin—was
          painted with beautifully
          even vertical green stripes.</p>
        <p>“I did it as a surprise for Gusterson,”
          she explained to Fay.
          “He says he likes me this way.
          The green glop’s supposed to be
          smudgeproof.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson did not comment.
          His face had a rapt expression.
          “I’ll tell you why your tickler’s
          so popular, Fay,” he said softly.
          “It’s not because it backstops the
          memory or because it boosts the
          ego with subliminals. It’s because
          it takes the hook out of a guy, it
          takes over the job of withstanding
          the pressure of living. See,
          Fay, here are all these little guys
          in this subterranean rat race with
          atomic-death squares and chromium-plated
          reward squares and
          enough money if you pass Go
          almost to get to Go again—and
          a million million rules of the
          game to keep in mind. Well,
          here’s this one little guy and
          every morning he wakes up
          there’s all these things he’s got
          to keep in mind to do or he’ll
          lose his turn three times in a row
          and maybe a terrible black rook
          in iron armor’ll loom up and bang
          him off the chessboard. But now,
          look, now he’s got his tickler and
          he tells his sweet silver tickler
          all these things and the tickler’s
          got to remember them. Of course
          he’ll have to do them eventually
          but meanwhile the pressure’s off
          him, the hook’s out of his short
          hairs. He’s shifted the responsibility….”</p>
        <p>“Well, what’s so bad about
          that?” Fay broke in loudly.
          “What’s wrong with taking the
          <a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>pressure off little guys? Why
          shouldn’t Tickler be a super-ego
          surrogate? Micro’s Motivations
          chief noticed that positive feature
          straight off and scored it
          three pluses. Besides, it’s nothing
          but a gaudy way of saying that
          Tickler backstops the memory.
          Seriously, Gussy, what’s so bad
          about it?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” Gusterson said
          slowly, his eyes still far away. “I
          just know it feels bad to me.” He
          crinkled his big forehead. “Well
          for one thing,” he said, “it means
          that a man’s taking orders from
          something else. He’s got a kind
          of master. He’s sinking back into
          a slave psychology.”</p>
        <p>“He’s only taking orders from
          himself,” Fay countered disgustedly.
          “Tickler’s just a mech
          reminder, a notebook, in essence
          no more than the back of an old
          envelope. It’s no master.”</p>
        <p>“Are you absolutely sure of
          that?” Gusterson asked quietly.</p>
        <p>“Why, Gussy, you big oaf—”
          Fay began heatedly. Suddenly
          his features quirked and he
          twitched. “’Scuse me, folks,” he
          said rapidly, heading for the
          door, “but my tickler told me I
          gotta go.”</p>
        <p>“Hey Fay, don’t you mean you
          told your tickler to tell you when
          it was time to go?” Gusterson
          called after him.</p>
        <p>Fay looked back in the doorway.
          He wet his lips, his eyes
          moved from side to side. “I’m not
          quite sure,” he said in an odd
          strained voice and darted out.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> stared for some
          seconds at the pattern of
          emptiness Fay had left. Then he
          shivered. Then he shrugged. “I
          must be slipping,” he muttered.
          “I never even suggested something
          for him to invent.” Then he
          looked around at Daisy, who was
          still standing poker-faced in her
          doorway.</p>
        <p>“Hey, you look like something
          out of the Arabian Nights,” he
          told her. “Are you supposed to
          be anything special? How far do
          those stripes go, anyway?”</p>
        <p>“You could probably find out,”
          she told him coolly. “All you have
          to do is kill me a dragon or two
          first.”</p>
        <p>He studied her. “My God,” he
          said reverently, “I really have all
          the fun in life. What do I do to
          deserve this?”</p>
        <p>“You’ve got a big gun,” she
          told him, “and you go out in the
          world with it and hold up big
          companies and take yards and
          yards of money away from them
          in rolls like ribbon and bring it
          all home to me.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t say that about the gun
          again,” he said. “Don’t whisper it,
          don’t even think it. I’ve got one,
          dammit—thirty-eight caliber,
          yet—and I don’t want some
          psionic monitor with two-way
          <a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>clairaudience they haven’t told
          me about catching the whisper
          and coming to take the gun away
          from us. It’s one of the few individuality
          symbols we’ve got left.”</p>
        <p>Suddenly Daisy whirled away
          from the door, spun three times
          so that her silvered hair stood
          out like a metal coolie hat, and
          sank to a curtsey in the middle
          of the room.</p>
        <p>“I’ve just thought of what I
          am,” she announced, fluttering
          her eyelashes at him. “I’m a sweet
          silver tickler with green stripes.”</p>
        <h2>V</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">Next</span> day Daisy cashed the
          Micro check for ten hundred
          silver smackers, which she
          hid in a broken radionic coffee
          urn. Gusterson sold his insanity
          novel and started a new one
          about a mad medic with a hiccupy
          hysterical chuckle, who gimmicked
          Moodmasters to turn
          mental patients into nymphomaniacs,
          mass murderers and
          compulsive saints. But this time
          he couldn’t get Fay out of his
          mind, or the last chilling words
          the nervous little man had spoken.</p>
        <p>For that matter, he couldn’t
          blank the underground out of his
          mind as effectively as usually.
          He had the feeling that a new
          kind of mole was loose in the
          burrows and that the ground at
          the foot of their skyscraper might
          start humping up any minute.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of one afternoon
          he tucked a half dozen newly
          typed sheets in his pocket,
          shrouded his typer, went to the
          hatrack and took down his prize:
          a miner’s hard-top cap with electric
          headlamp.</p>
        <p>“Goin’ below, Cap’n,” he shouted
          toward the kitchen.</p>
        <p>“Be back for second dog
          watch,” Daisy replied. “Remember
          what I told you about lassoing
          me some art-conscious girl
          neighbors.”</p>
        <p>“Only if I meet a piebald one
          with a taste for Scotch—or maybe
          a pearl gray biped jaguar with
          violet spots,” Gusterson told her,
          clapping on the cap with a We-<ins title="Who Are">Who-Are</ins>-About-To-Die gesture.</p>
        <p>Halfway across the park to the
          escalator bunker Gusterson’s
          heart began to tick. He resolutely
          switched on his headlamp.</p>
        <p>As he’d known it would, the
          hatch robot whirred an extra
          and higher-pitched ten seconds
          when it came to his topside address,
          but it ultimately dilated
          the hatch for him, first handing
          him a claim check for his ID card.</p>
        <p>Gusterson’s heart was ticking
          like a sledgehammer by now. He
          hopped clumsily onto the escalator,
          clutched the moving guard
          rail to either side, then shut his
          eyes as the steps went over the
          edge and became what felt like
          <a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>vertical. An instant later he
          forced his eyes open, unclipped a
          hand from the rail and touched
          the second switch beside his headlamp,
          which instantly began to
          blink whitely, as if he were a
          civilian plane flying into a nest
          of military jobs.</p>
        <p>With a further effort he kept
          his eyes open and flinchingly surveyed
          the scene around him.
          After zigging through a bombproof
          half-furlong of roof, he was
          dropping into a large twilit cave.
          The blue-black ceiling twinkled
          with stars. The walls were pierced
          at floor level by a dozen archways
          with busy niche stores and
          glowing advertisements crowded
          between them. From the archways
          some three dozen slidewalks
          curved out, tangenting off each
          other in a bewildering multiple
          cloverleaf. The slidewalks were
          packed with people, traveling motionless
          like purposeful statues or
          pivoting with practiced grace
          from one slidewalk to another,
          like a thousand toreros doing veronicas.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">The</span> slidewalks were moving
          faster than he recalled from
          his last venture underground and
          at the same time the whole pedestrian
          concourse was quieter than
          he remembered. It was as if the
          five thousand or so moles in view
          were all listening—for what?
          But there was something else
          that had changed about them—a
          change that he couldn’t for a
          moment define, or unconsciously
          didn’t want to. Clothing style?
          No … My God, they weren’t all
          wearing identical monster masks?
          No … Hair color?… Well….</p>
        <p>He was studying them so intently
          that he forgot his escalator
          was landing. He came off it with
          a heel-jarring stumble and bumped
          into a knot of four men on the
          tiny triangular hold-still. These
          four at least sported a new style-wrinkle:
          ribbed gray shoulder-capes
          that made them look as if
          their heads were poking up out
          of the center of bulgy umbrellas
          or giant mushrooms.</p>
        <p>One of them grabbed hold of
          Gusterson and saved him from
          staggering onto a slidewalk that
          might have carried him to Toledo.</p>
        <p>“Gussy, you dog, you must
          have esped I wanted to see you,”
          Fay cried, patting him on the elbows.
          “Meet Davidson and Kester
          and Hazen, colleagues of
          mine. We’re all Micro-men.”
          Fay’s companions were staring
          strangely at Gusterson’s blinking
          headlamp. Fay explained rapidly,
          “Mr. Gusterson is an insanity
          novelist. You know, I-D.”</p>
        <p>“Inner-directed spells <em>id</em>,” Gusterson
          said absently, still staring
          at the interweaving crowd beyond
          them, trying to figure out
          what made them different from
          <a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"></a>last trip. “Creativity fuel. Cranky.
          Explodes through the parietal fissure
          if you look at it cross-eyed.”</p>
        <p>“Ha-ha,” Fay laughed. “Well,
          boys, I’ve found my man. How’s
          the new novel perking, Gussy?”</p>
        <p>“Got my climax, I think,” Gusterson
          mumbled, still peering
          puzzledly around Fay at the
          slidestanders. “Moodmaster’s going
          to come alive. Ever occur to
          you that ‘mood’ is ‘doom’ spelled
          backwards? And then….” He
          let his voice trail off as he realized
          that Kester and Davidson
          and Hazen had made their farewells
          and were sliding into the
          distance. He reminded himself
          wryly that nobody ever wants to
          hear an author talk—he’s much
          too good a listener to be wasted
          that way. Let’s see, was it that
          everybody in the crowd had the
          same facial expression…? Or
          showed symptoms of the same
          disease…?</p>
        <p>“I was coming to visit you, but
          now you can pay me a call,” Fay
          was saying. “There are two matters
          I want to—”</p>
        <p>Gusterson stiffened. “My God,
          <em>they’re all hunchbacked</em>!” he
          yelled.</p>
        <p>“Shh! Of course they are,” Fay
          whispered reprovingly. “They’re
          all wearing their ticklers. But you
          don’t need to be insulting about
          it.”</p>
        <p>“<em>I’m gettin’ out o’ here.</em>” Gusterson
          turned to flee as if from
          five thousand Richard the Thirds.</p>
        <p>“Oh no you’re not,” Fay
          amended, drawing him back with
          one hand. Somehow, underground,
          the little man seemed to
          carry more weight. “You’re having
          cocktails in my thinking box.
          Besides, climbing a down escaladder
          will give you a heart attack.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">In his</span> home habitat Gusterson
          was about as easy to handle
          as a rogue rhinoceros, but away
          from it—and especially if underground—he
          became more
          like a pliable elephant. All his
          bones dropped out through his
          feet, as he described it to Daisy.
          So now he submitted miserably
          as Fay surveyed him up and
          down, switched off his blinking
          headlamp (“That coalminer caper
          is corny, Gussy.”) and then—surprisingly—rapidly
          stuffed his
          belt-bag under the right shoulder
          of Gusterson’s coat and buttoned
          the latter to hold it in place.</p>
        <p>“So you won’t stand out,” he
          explained. Another swift survey.
          “You’ll do. Come on, Gussy. I got
          lots to brief you on.” Three rapid
          paces and then Gusterson’s feet
          would have gone out from under
          him except that Fay gave him a
          mighty shove. The small man
          sprang onto the slidewalk after
          him and then they were skimming
          effortlessly side by side.</p>
        <p>Gusterson felt frightened and
          <a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>twice as hunchbacked as the
          slidestanders around him—morally
          as well as physically.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless he countered
          bravely, “I got things to brief <em>you</em>
          on. I got six pages of cautions on
          ti—”</p>
        <p>“Shh!” Fay stopped him. “Let’s
          use my hushbox.”</p>
        <p>He drew out his pancake phone
          and stretched it so that it covered
          both their lower faces, like a
          double yashmak. Gusterson, his
          neck pushing into the ribbed
          bulge of the shoulder cape so he
          could be cheek to cheek with
          Fay, felt horribly conspicuous,
          but then he noticed that none of
          the slidestanders were paying
          them the least attention. The
          reason for their abstraction occurred
          to him. They were listening
          to their ticklers! He shuddered.</p>
        <p>“I got six pages of caution on
          ticklers,” he repeated into the hot,
          moist quiet of the pancake phone.
          “I typed ’em so I wouldn’t forget
          ’em in the heat of polemicking.
          I want you to read every word.
          Fay, I’ve had it on my mind ever
          since I started wondering whether
          it was you or your tickler
          made you duck out of our place
          last time you were there. I want
          you to—”</p>
        <p>“Ha-ha! All in good time.” In
          the pancake phone Fay’s laugh
          was brassy. “But I’m glad you’ve
          decided to lend a hand, Gussy.
          This thing is moving faaaasst.
          Nationwise, adult underground
          ticklerization is 90 per cent complete.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe that,” Gusterson
          protested while glaring at the
          hunchbacks around them. The
          slidewalk was gliding down a low
          glow-ceiling tunnel lined with
          doors and advertisements. Rapt-eyed
          people were pirouetting on
          and off. “A thing just can’t develop
          that fast, Fay. It’s against
          nature.”</p>
        <p>“Ha, but we’re not in nature,
          we’re in culture. The progress of
          an industrial scientific culture is
          geometric. It goes n-times as
          many jumps as it takes. More
          than geometric—exponential.
          Confidentially, Micro’s Math
          chief tells me we’re currently on
          a fourth-power progress curve
          trending into a fifth.”</p>
        <p>“You mean we’re goin’ so fast
          we got to watch out we don’t
          bump ourselves in the rear when
          we come around again?” Gusterson
          asked, scanning the tunnel
          ahead for curves. “Or just shoot
          straight up to infinity?”</p>
        <p>“Exactly! Of course most of the
          last power and a half is due to
          Tickler itself. Gussy, the tickler’s
          already eliminated absenteeism,
          alcoholism and aboulia in numerous
          urban areas—and that’s just
          one letter of the alphabet! If
          Tickler doesn’t turn us into a
          nation of photo-memory constant-creative-flow
          <a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>geniuses in six
          months, I’ll come live topside.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“You</span> mean because a lot of
          people are standing around
          glassy-eyed listening to something
          mumbling in their ear that
          it’s a good thing?”</p>
        <p>“Gussy, you don’t know progress
          when you see it. Tickler is
          the greatest invention since language.
          Bar none, it’s the greatest
          instrument ever devised for integrating
          a man into all phases of
          his environment. Under the present
          routine a newly purchased
          tickler first goes to government
          and civilian defense for primary
          patterning, then to the purchaser’s
          employer, then to his doctor-psycher,
          then to his local bunker
          captain, then to <em>him</em>. <em>Everything</em>
          that’s needful for a man’s welfare
          gets on the spools. Efficiency
          cubed! Incidentally, Russia’s got
          the tickler now. Our dip-satellites
          have photographed it. It’s like
          ours except the Commies wear it
          on the left shoulder … but
          they’re two weeks behind us developmentwise
          and they’ll never
          close the gap!”</p>
        <p>Gusterson reared up out of the
          pancake phone to take a deep
          breath. A sulky-lipped sylph-figured
          girl two feet from him
          twitched—medium cootch, he
          judged—then fumbled in her
          belt-bag for a pill and popped it
          in her mouth.</p>
        <p>“Hell, the tickler’s not even efficient
          yet about little things,”
          Gusterson blatted, diving back
          into the privacy-yashmak he was
          sharing with Fay. “Whyn’t that
          girl’s doctor have the Moodmaster
          component of her tickler
          inject her with medicine?”</p>
        <p>“Her doctor probably wants
          her to have the discipline of pill-taking—or
          the exercise,” Fay
          answered glibly. “Look sharp
          now. Here’s where we fork. I’m
          taking you through Micro’s postern.”</p>
        <p>A ribbon of slidewalk split itself
          from the main band and
          angled off into a short alley.
          Gusterson hardly felt the constant-speed
          juncture as they
          crossed it. Then the secondary
          ribbon speeded up, carrying them
          at about 30 feet a second toward
          the blank concrete wall in which
          the alley ended. Gusterson prepared
          to jump, but Fay grabbed
          him with one hand and with the
          other held up toward the wall a
          badge and a button. When they
          were about ten feet away the
          wall whipped aside, then whipped
          shut behind them so fast that
          Gusterson wondered momentarily
          if he still had his heels and the
          seat of his pants.</p>
        <p>Fay, tucking away his badge
          and pancake phone, dropped the
          button in Gusterson’s vest pocket.
          “Use it when you leave,” he said
          casually. “That is, if you leave.”</p>
        <p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>Gusterson, who was trying to
          read the Do and Don’t posters
          papering the walls they were
          passing, started to probe that last
          sinister supposition, but just then
          the ribbon slowed, a swinging
          door opened and closed behind
          them and they found themselves
          in a luxuriously furnished thinking
          box measuring at least eight
          feet by five.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">“Hey</span>, this is something,”
          Gusterson said appreciatively
          to show he wasn’t an utter
          yokel. Then, drawing on research
          he’d done for period novels,
          “Why, it’s as big as a Pullman
          car compartment, or a first mate’s
          cabin in the War of 1812. You
          really must rate.”</p>
        <p>Fay nodded, smiled wanly and
          sat down with a sigh on a compact
          overstuffed swivel chair. He
          let his arms dangle and his head
          sink into his puffed shoulder
          cape. Gusterson stared at him. It
          was the first time he could ever
          recall the little man showing fatigue.</p>
        <p>“Tickler currently does have
          one serious drawback,” Fay volunteered.
          “It weighs 28 pounds.
          You feel it when you’ve been on
          your feet a couple of hours. No
          question we’re going to give the
          next model that antigravity feature
          you mentioned for pursuit
          grenades. We’d have had it in this
          model except there were so many
          other things to be incorporated.”
          He sighed again. “Why, the scanning
          <ins title="and and">and</ins> decision-making elements
          alone tripled the mass.”</p>
        <p>“Hey,” Gusterson protested,
          thinking especially of the sulky-lipped
          girl, “do you mean to tell
          me all those other people were
          toting two stone?”</p>
        <p>Fay shook his head heavily.
          “They were all wearing Mark 3
          or 4. I’m wearing Mark 6,” he
          said, as one might say, “I’m carrying
          the genuine Cross, not one of
          the balsa ones.”</p>
        <p>But then his face brightened a
          little and he went on. “Of course
          the new improved features make
          it more than worth it … and you
          hardly feel it at all at night when
          you’re lying down … and if you
          remember to talcum under it
          twice a day, no sores develop …
          at least not very big ones….”</p>
        <p>Backing away involuntarily,
          Gusterson felt something prod
          his right shoulderblade. Ripping
          open his coat, he convulsively
          plunged his hand under it and
          tore out Fay’s belt-bag … and
          then set it down very gently on
          the top of a shallow cabinet and
          relaxed with the sigh of one who
          has escaped a great, if symbolic,
          danger. Then he remembered
          something Fay had mentioned.
          He straightened again.</p>
        <p>“Hey, you said it’s got scanning
          and decision-making elements.
          That means your tickler thinks,
          <a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>even by your fancy standards.
          And if it thinks, it’s conscious.”</p>
        <p>“Gussy,” Fay said wearily,
          frowning, “all sorts of things nowadays
          have S&amp;DM elements.
          Mail sorters, missiles, robot medics,
          high-style mannequins, just to
          name some of the Ms. They
          ‘think,’ to use that <ins title="archiac">archaic</ins> word,
          but it’s neither here nor there.
          And they’re certainly not conscious.”</p>
        <p>“Your tickler thinks,” Gusterson
          repeated stubbornly, “just
          like I warned you it would. It sits
          on your shoulder, ridin’ you like
          you was a pony or a starved St.
          Bernard, and now it thinks.”</p>
        <p>“Suppose it does?” Fay yawned.
          “What of it?” He gave a rapid
          sinuous one-sided shrug that
          made it look for a moment as if
          his left arm had three elbows. It
          stuck in Gusterson’s mind, for he
          had never seen Fay use such a
          gesture and he wondered where
          he’d picked it up. Maybe imitating
          a double-jointed Micro Finance
          chief? Fay yawned again
          and said, “Please, Gussy, don’t
          disturb me for a minute or so.”
          His eyes half closed.</p>
        <p>Gusterson studied Fay’s sunken-cheeked
          face and the great
          puff of his shoulder cape.</p>
        <p>“Say, Fay,” he asked in a soft
          voice after about five minutes,
          “are you meditating?”</p>
        <p>“Why, no,” Fay responded,
          starting up and then stifling another
          yawn. “Just resting a bit.
          I seem to get more tired these
          days, somehow. You’ll have to excuse
          me, Gussy. But what made
          you think of meditation?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I just got to wonderin’ in
          that direction,” Gusterson said.
          “You see, when you first started
          to develop Tickler, it occurred to
          me that there was one thing
          about it that might be real good
          even if you did give it S&amp;DM
          elements. It’s this: having a mech
          secretary to take charge of his
          obligations and routine in the real
          world might allow a man to slide
          into the other world, the world of
          thoughts and feelings and intuitions,
          and sort of ooze around in
          there and accomplish things.
          Know any of the people using
          Tickler that way, hey?”</p>
        <p>“Of course not,” Fay denied
          with a bright incredulous laugh.
          “Who’d want to loaf around in an
          imaginary world and take a
          chance of <em>missing out on what his
          tickler’s doing?</em>—I mean, on
          what his tickler has in store for
          him—what he’s <em>told</em> his tickler
          to have in store for him.”</p>
        <p>Ignoring Gusterson’s shiver,
          Fay straightened up and seemed
          to brisken himself. “Ha, that
          little slump did me good. A tickler
          <em>makes</em> you rest, you know—it’s
          one of the great things about
          it. Pooh-Bah’s kinder to me than
          I ever was to myself.” He buttoned
          open a tiny refrigerator and
          <a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>took out two waxed cardboard
          cubes and handed one to Gusterson.
          “Martini? Hope you don’t
          mind drinking from the carton.
          Cheers. Now, Gussy old pal, there
          are two matters I want to take
          up with you—”</p>
        <p>“Hold it,” Gusterson said with
          something of his old authority.
          “There’s something I got to get
          off my mind first.” He pulled the
          typed pages out of his inside
          pocket and straightened them. “I
          told you about these,” he said.
          “I want you to read them before
          you do anything else. Here.”</p>
        <p>Fay looked toward the pages
          and nodded, but did not take
          them yet. He lifted his hands to
          his throat and unhooked the
          clasp of his cape, then hesitated.</p>
        <p>“You wear that thing to hide
          the hump your tickler makes?”
          Gusterson filled in. “You got better
          taste than those other moles.”</p>
        <p>“Not to hide it, exactly,” Fay
          protested, “but just so the others
          won’t be jealous. I wouldn’t feel
          comfortable parading a free-scanning
          decision-capable Mark
          6 tickler in front of people who
          can’t buy it—until it goes on
          open sale at twenty-two fifteen
          tonight. Lot of shelterfolk won’t
          be sleeping tonight. They’ll be
          queued up to trade in their old
          tickler for a Mark 6 almost as
          good as Pooh-Bah.”</p>
        <p>He started to jerk his hands
          apart, hesitated again with an
          oddly apprehensive look at the
          big man, then whirled off the
          cape.</p>
        <h2>VI</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> sucked in such a
          big gasp that he hiccuped.
          The right shoulder of Fay’s jacket
          and shirt had been cut away.
          Thrusting up through the neatly
          hemmed hole was a silvery gray
          hump with a one-eyed turret
          atop it and two multi-jointed
          metal arms ending in little claws.</p>
        <p>It looked like the top half of
          a pseudo-science robot—a squat
          evil child robot, Gusterson told
          himself, which had lost its legs
          in a railway accident—and it
          seemed to him that a red fleck
          was moving around imperceptibly
          in the huge single eye.</p>
        <p>“I’ll take that memo now,” Fay
          said coolly, reaching out his
          hand. He caught the rustling
          sheets as they slipped from Gusterson’s
          fingers, evened them up
          very precisely by tapping them
          on his knee … and then handed
          them over his shoulder to his
          tickler, which clicked its claws
          around either margin and then
          began rather swiftly to lift the
          top sheet past its single eye at a
          distance of about six inches.</p>
        <p>“The first matter I want to
          take up with you, Gussy,” Fay
          began, paying no attention whatsoever
          to the little scene on his
          <a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>shoulder, “—or warn you about,
          rather—is the imminent ticklerization
          of schoolchildren, geriatrics,
          convicts and topsiders. At
          three zero zero tomorrow ticklers
          become mandatory for all adult
          shelterfolk. The mop-up operations
          won’t be long in coming—in
          fact, these days we find that
          the square root of the estimated
          time of a new development is
          generally the best time estimate.
          Gussy, I strongly advise you to
          start wearing a tickler now. And
          Daisy and your moppets. If you
          heed my advice, your kids will
          have the jump on your class.
          Transition and conditioning are
          easy, since Tickler itself sees to
          it.”</p>
        <p>Pooh-Bah leafed the first page
          to the back of the packet and began
          lifting the second past his
          eye—a little more swiftly than
          the first.</p>
        <p>“I’ve got a Mark 6 tickler all
          warmed up for you,” Fay pressed,
          “<em>and</em> a shoulder cape. You won’t
          feel one bit conspicuous.” He noticed
          the direction of Gusterson’s
          gaze and remarked, “Fascinating
          mechanism, isn’t it? Of course 28
          pounds are a bit oppressive, but
          then you have to remember it’s
          only a way-station to free-floating
          Mark 7 or 8.”</p>
        <p>Pooh-Bah finished page two
          and began to race through page
          three.</p>
        <p>“But I wanted <em>you</em> to read it,”
          Gusterson said bemusedly, staring.</p>
        <p>“Pooh-Bah will do a better job
          than I could,” Fay assured him.
          “Get the gist without losing the
          chaff.”</p>
        <p>“But dammit, it’s all about
          <em>him</em>,” Gusterson said a little more
          strongly. “He won’t be objective
          about it.”</p>
        <p>“A better job,” Fay reiterated,
          “<em>and</em> more fully objective. Pooh-Bah’s
          set for full precis. Stop
          worrying about it. He’s a dispassionate
          machine, not a fallible,
          emotionally disturbed human
          misled by the will-o’-the-wisp of
          consciousness. Second matter:
          Micro Systems is impressed by
          your contributions to Tickler and
          will recruit you as a senior consultant
          with a salary and thinking
          box as big as my own, family
          quarters to match. It’s an unheard-of
          high start. Gussy, I think
          you’d be a fool—”</p>
        <div class="image"><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>
        <img alt="A group of people look at a tower in the distance that has small objects flying around it." height="517" src="images/illo-4.jpg" width="400"/>
        </div>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">He broke</span> off, held up a hand
          for silence, and his eyes got
          a listening look. Pooh-Bah had
          finished page six and was holding
          the packet motionless. After
          about ten seconds Fay’s face
          broke into a big fake smile. He
          stood up, suppressing a wince,
          and held out his hand. “Gussy,”
          he said loudly, “I am happy to
          inform you that all your fears
          about Tickler are so much thistledown.
          My word on it. There’s
          <a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"></a>nothing to them at all. Pooh-Bah’s
          precis, which he’s just given
          to me, proves it.”</p>
        <p>“Look,” Gusterson said solemnly,
          “there’s one thing I want you
          to do. Purely to humor an old
          friend. But I want you to do it.
          <em>Read that memo yourself.</em>”</p>
        <p>“Certainly I will, Gussy,” Fay
          continued in the same ebullient
          tones. “I’ll read it—” he twitched
          and his smile disappeared—“a
          little later.”</p>
        <p>“Sure,” Gusterson said dully,
          holding his hand to his stomach.
          “And now if you don’t mind, Fay,
          I’m goin’ home. I feel just a bit
          sick. Maybe the ozone and the
          other additives in your shelter
          air are too heady for me. It’s been
          years since I tramped through a
          pine forest.”</p>
        <p>“But Gussy! You’ve hardly got
          here. You haven’t even sat down.
          Have another martini. Have a
          seltzer pill. Have a whiff of oxy.
          Have a—”</p>
        <p>“No, Fay, I’m going home right
          away. I’ll think about the job
          offer. <i>Remember to read that
          memo.</i>”</p>
        <p>“I will, Gussy, I certainly will.
          You know your way? The button
          takes you through the wall. ’By,
          now.”</p>
        <p>He sat down abruptly and
          looked away. Gusterson pushed
          through the swinging door. He
          tensed himself for the step across
          onto the slowly-moving reverse
          ribbon. Then on a impulse he
          pushed ajar the swinging door
          and looked back inside.</p>
        <p>Fay was sitting as he’d left
          him, apparently lost in listless
          brooding. On his shoulder Pooh-Bah
          was rapidly crossing and uncrossing
          its little metal arms,
          tearing the memo to smaller and
          smaller shreds. It let the scraps
          drift slowly toward the floor and
          oddly writhed its three-elbowed
          left arm … and then Gusterson
          knew from whom, or rather from
          what, Fay had copied his new
          shrug.</p>
        <h2>VII</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">When</span> Gusterson got home
          toward the end of the second
          dog watch, he slipped aside
          from Daisy’s questions and set
          the children laughing with a
          graphic enactment of his slidestanding
          technique and a story
          about getting his head caught in
          a thinking box built for a midget
          physicist. After supper he played
          with Imogene, Iago and Claudius
          until it was their bedtime and
          thereafter was unusually attentive
          to Daisy, admiring her fading
          green stripes, though he did
          spend a while in the next apartment,
          where they stored their outdoor
          camping equipment.</p>
        <p>But the next morning he announced
          to the children that it
          was a holiday—the Feast of St.
          <a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"></a>Gusterson—and then took Daisy
          into the bedroom and told her
          everything.</p>
        <p>When he’d finished she said,
          “This is something I’ve got to see
          for myself.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson shrugged. “If you
          think you’ve got to. I say we
          should head for the hills right
          now. One thing I’m standing on:
          the kids aren’t going back to
          school.”</p>
        <p>“Agreed,” Daisy said. “But,
          Gusterson, we’ve lived through a
          lot of things without leaving
          home altogether. We lived
          through the Everybody-Six-Feet-Underground-by-Christmas
          campaign
          and the Robot Watchdog
          craze, when you got your left foot
          half chewed off. We lived through
          the Venomous Bats and Indoctrinated
          Saboteur Rats and the
          Hypnotized Monkey Paratrooper
          scares. We lived through the
          Voice of Safety and Anti-Communist
          Somno-Instruction and
          Rightest Pills and Jet-Propelled
          Vigilantes. We lived through the
          Cold-Out, when you weren’t supposed
          to turn on a toaster for
          fear its heat would be a target
          for prowl missiles and when people
          with fevers were unpopular.
          We lived through—”</p>
        <p>Gusterson patted her hand.
          “You go below,” he said. “Come
          back when you’ve decided this is
          different. Come back as soon as
          you can anyway. I’ll be worried
          about you every minute you’re
          down there.”</p>
        <p>When she was gone—in a
          green suit and hat to minimize or
          at least justify the effect of the
          faded stripes—Gusterson doled
          out to the children provender and
          equipment for a camping expedition
          to the next floor. Iago led
          them off in stealthy Indian file.
          Leaving the hall door open Gusterson
          got out his .38 and cleaned
          and loaded it, meanwhile concentrating
          on a chess problem with
          the idea of confusing a hypothetical
          psionic monitor. By the time
          he had hid the revolver again he
          heard the elevator creaking back
          up.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Daisy</span> came dragging in without
          her hat, looking as if
          she’d been concentrating on a
          chess problem for hours herself
          and just now given up. Her stripes
          seemed to have vanished; then
          Gusterson decided this was because
          her whole complexion was
          a touch green.</p>
        <p>She sat down on the edge of
          the couch and said without looking
          at him, “Did you tell me,
          Gusterson, that everybody was
          quiet and abstracted and orderly
          down below, especially the ones
          wearing ticklers, meaning pretty
          much everybody?”</p>
        <p>“I did,” he said. “I take it that’s
          no longer the case. What are the
          new symptoms?”</p>
        <p><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"></a>She gave no indication. After
          some time she said, “Gusterson,
          do you remember the Doré illustrations
          to the <em>Inferno</em>? Can you
          visualize the paintings of Hieronymous
          Bosch with the hordes
          of proto-Freudian devils tormenting
          people all over the farmyard
          and city square? Did you ever
          see the Disney animations of
          Moussorgsky’s witches’ sabbath
          music? Back in the foolish days
          before you married me, did that
          drug-addict girl friend of yours
          ever take you to <ins title="word was missing">a</ins> genuine orgy?”</p>
        <p>“As bad as that, hey?”</p>
        <p>She nodded emphatically and
          all of a sudden shivered violently.
          “Several shades worse,” she said.
          “If they decide to come topside—”
          She shot up. “Where are
          the kids?”</p>
        <p>“Upstairs campin’ in the mysterious
          wilderness of the 21st
          floor,” Gusterson reassured her.
          “Let’s leave ’em there until we’re
          ready to—”</p>
        <p>He broke off. They both heard
          the faint sound of thudding footsteps.</p>
        <p>“They’re on the stairs,” Daisy
          whispered, starting to move toward
          the open door. “But are
          they coming from up or down?”</p>
        <p>“It’s just one person,” judged
          Gusterson, moving after his wife.
          “Too heavy for one of the kids.”</p>
        <p>The footsteps doubled in volume
          and came rapidly closer.
          Along with them there was an
          agonized gasping. Daisy stopped,
          staring fearfully at the open doorway.
          Gusterson moved past her.
          Then he stopped too.</p>
        <p>Fay stumbled into view and
          would have fallen on his face except
          he clutched both sides of the
          doorway halfway up. He was
          stripped to the waist. There was
          a little blood on his shoulder. His
          narrow chest was arching convulsively,
          the ribs standing out
          starkly, as he sucked in oxygen
          to replace what he’d burned up
          running up twenty flights. His
          eyes were wild.</p>
        <p>“They’ve taken over,” he panted.
          Another gobbling breath.
          “Gone crazy.” Two more gasps.
          “Gotta stop ’em.”</p>
        <p>His eyes filmed. He swayed
          forward. Then Gusterson’s big
          arms were around him and he
          was carrying him to the couch.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Daisy</span> came running from the
          kitchen with a damp cool
          towel. Gusterson took it from her
          and began to mop Fay off. He
          sucked in his own breath as he
          saw that Fay’s right ear was raw
          and torn. He whispered to Daisy,
          “Look at where the thing savaged
          him.”</p>
        <p>The blood on Fay’s shoulder
          came from his ear. Some of it
          stained a flush-skin plastic fitting
          that had two small valved holes
          in it and that puzzled Gusterson
          until he remembered that Moodmaster
          <a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"></a>tied into the bloodstream.
          For a second he thought he was
          going to vomit.</p>
        <p>The dazed look slid aside from
          Fay’s eyes. He was gasping less
          painfully now. He sat up, pushing
          the towel away, buried his face
          in his hands for a few seconds,
          then looked over the fingers at
          the two of them.</p>
        <p>“I’ve been living in a nightmare
          for the last week,” he said
          in a taut small voice, “knowing
          the thing had come alive and trying
          to pretend to myself that it
          hadn’t. Knowing it was taking
          charge of me more and more.
          Having it whisper in my ear, over
          and over again, in a cracked little
          rhyme that I could only hear
          every hundredth time, ‘Day by
          day, in every way, you’re learning
          to listen … and <em>obey</em>. Day by
          day—’”</p>
        <p>His voice started to go high. He
          pulled it down and continued
          harshly, “I ditched it this morning
          when I showered. It let me
          break contact to do that. It must
          have figured it had complete control
          of me, mounted or dismounted.
          I think it’s telepathic, and
          then it did some, well, rather unpleasant
          things to me late last
          night. But I pulled together my
          fears and my will and I ran for it.
          The slidewalks were chaos. The
          Mark 6 ticklers showed some purpose,
          though I couldn’t tell you
          what, but as far as I could see
          the Mark 3s and 4s were just
          cootching their mounts to death—Chinese
          feather torture. Giggling,
          gasping, choking … gales
          of mirth. People are dying of
          laughter … ticklers!… the irony
          of it! It was the complete lack of
          order and sanity and that let me
          get topside. There were things I
          saw—” Once again his voice went
          shrill. He clapped his hand to his
          mouth and rocked back and forth
          on the couch.</p>
        <p>Gusterson gently but firmly
          laid a hand on his good shoulder.
          “Steady,” he said. “Here, swallow
          this.”</p>
        <p>Fay shoved aside the short
          brown drink. “We’ve got to stop
          them,” he cried. “Mobilize the
          topsiders—contact the wilderness
          patrols and manned satellites—pour
          ether in the tunnel
          airpumps—invent and crash-manufacture
          missiles that will
          home on ticklers without harming
          humans—SOS Mars and
          Venus—dope the shelter water
          supply—do something! Gussy,
          you don’t realize what people
          are going through down there
          every second.”</p>
        <p>“I think they’re experiencing
          the ultimate in outer-directedness,”
          Gusterson said gruffly.</p>
        <p>“Have you no heart?” <ins title="Gay">Fay</ins> demanded.
          His eyes widened, as if
          he were seeing Gusterson for the
          first time. Then, accusingly, pointing
          a shaking finger: “<i>You invented
          <a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"></a>the tickler, George Gusterson!
          It’s all your fault! You’ve got
          to do something about it!</i>”</p>
        <p>Before Gusterson could retort
          to that, or begin to think of a
          reply, or even assimilate the full
          enormity of Fay’s statement, he
          was grabbed from behind and
          frog-marched away from Fay and
          something that felt remarkably
          like the muzzle of a large-caliber
          gun was shoved in the small of
          his back.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Under cover</span> of Fay’s outburst
          a huge crowd of people
          had entered the room from
          the hall—eight, to be exact. But
          the weirdest thing about them to
          Gusterson was that from the first
          instant he had the impression
          that only one mind had entered
          the room and that it did not reside
          in any of the eight persons,
          even though he recognized three
          of them, but in something that
          they were carrying.</p>
        <p>Several things contributed to
          this impression. The eight people
          all had the same blank expression—watchful
          yet empty-eyed.
          They all moved in the same
          slithery crouch. And they had all
          taken off their shoes. Perhaps,
          Gusterson thought wildly, they
          believed he and Daisy ran a
          Japanese flat.</p>
        <p>Gusterson was being held by
          two burly women, one of them
          quite pimply. He considered
          stamping on her toes, but just at
          that moment the gun dug in his
          back with a corkscrew movement.</p>
        <p>The man holding the gun on
          him was Fay’s colleague Davidson.
          Some yards beyond Fay’s
          couch, Kester was holding a gun
          on Daisy, without digging it into
          her, while the single strange man
          holding Daisy herself was doing
          so quite decorously—a circumstance
          which afforded Gusterson
          minor relief, since it made him
          feel less guilty about not going
          berserk.</p>
        <p>Two more strange men, one of
          them in purple lounging pajamas,
          the other in the gray uniform of
          a slidewalk inspector, had
          grabbed Fay’s skinny upper
          arms, one on either side, and
          were lifting him to his feet, while
          Fay was struggling with such
          desperate futility and gibbering
          so pitifully that Gusterson momentarily
          had second thoughts
          about the moral imperative to go
          berserk when menaced by hostile
          force. But again the gun dug into
          him with a twist.</p>
        <p>Approaching Fay face-on was
          the third Micro-man Gusterson
          had met yesterday—Hazen. It
          was Hazen who was carrying—quite
          reverently or solemnly—or
          at any rate very carefully the
          object that seemed to Gusterson
          to be the mind of the little storm
          troop presently desecrating the
          <a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"></a>sanctity of his own individual
          home.</p>
        <p>All of them were wearing ticklers,
          of course—the three Micro-men
          the heavy emergent Mark
          6s with their clawed and jointed
          arms and monocular cephalic
          turrets, the rest lower-numbered
          Marks of the sort that merely
          made Richard-the-Third humps
          under clothing.</p>
        <p>The object that Hazen was
          carrying was the Mark 6 tickler
          Gusterson had seen Fay wearing
          yesterday. Gusterson was sure it
          was Pooh-Bah because of its air
          of command, and because he
          would have sworn on a mountain
          of Bibles that he recognized the
          red fleck lurking in the back of
          its single eye. And Pooh-Bah
          alone had the aura of full conscious
          thought. Pooh-Bah alone
          had mana.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">It is not</span> good to see an evil
          legless child robot with dangling
          straps bossing—apparently
          by telepathic power—not
          only three objects of its own kind
          and five close primitive relatives,
          but also eight human beings …
          and in addition throwing into a
          state of twitching terror one miserable,
          thin-chested, half-crazy
          research-and-development director.</p>
        <p>Pooh-Bah pointed a claw at
          Fay. Fay’s handlers dragged him
          forward, still resisting but more
          feebly now, as if half-hypnotized
          or at least cowed.</p>
        <p>Gusterson grunted an outraged,
          “Hey!” and automatically struggled
          a bit, but once more the gun
          dug in. Daisy shut her eyes, then
          firmed her mouth and opened
          them again to look.</p>
        <p>Seating the tickler on Fay’s
          shoulder took a little time, because
          two blunt spikes in its bottom
          had to be fitted into the
          valved holes in the flush-skin
          plastic disk. When at last they
          plunged home Gusterson felt
          very sick indeed—and then
          even more so, as the tickler itself
          poked a tiny pellet on a fine wire
          into Fay’s ear.</p>
        <p>The next moment Fay had
          straightened up and motioned his
          handlers aside. He tightened the
          straps of his tickler around his
          chest and under his armpits. He
          held out a hand and someone
          gave him a shoulderless shirt and
          coat. He slipped into them
          smoothly, Pooh-Bah dexterously
          using its little claws to help put
          its turret and body through the
          neatly hemmed holes. The small
          storm troop looked at Fay with
          deferential expectation. He held
          still for a moment, as if thinking,
          and then walked over to Gusterson
          and looked him in the face
          and again held still.</p>
        <p>Fay’s expression was jaunty on
          the surface, agonized underneath.
          Gusterson knew that he wasn’t
          <a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"></a>thinking at all, but only listening
          for instructions from something
          that was whispering on the very
          threshold of his inner ear.</p>
        <p>“Gussy, old boy,” Fay said,
          twitching a depthless grin, “I’d
          be very much obliged if you’d
          answer a few simple questions.”
          His voice was hoarse at first but
          he swallowed twice and corrected
          that. “What exactly did
          you have in mind when you invented
          ticklers? What exactly
          are they supposed to be?”</p>
        <p>“Why, you miserable—” Gusterson
          began in a kind of confused
          horror, then got hold of
          himself and said curtly, “They
          were supposed to be mech reminders.
          They were supposed to
          record memoranda and—”</p>
        <p>Fay held up a palm and shook
          his head and again listened for a
          space. Then, “That’s how ticklers
          were supposed to be of use to
          humans,” he said. “I don’t mean
          that at all. I mean how ticklers
          were supposed to be of use to
          themselves. Surely you had some
          notion.” Fay wet his lips. “If it’s
          any help,” he added, “keep in
          mind that it’s not Fay who’s asking
          this question, but Pooh-Bah.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson hesitated. He had
          the feeling that every one of the
          eight dual beings in the room
          was hanging on his answer and
          that something was boring into
          his mind and turning over his
          next thoughts and peering at and
          under them before he had a
          chance to scan them himself.
          Pooh-Bah’s eye was like a red
          searchlight.</p>
        <p>“Go on,” Fay prompted. “What
          were ticklers supposed to be—for
          themselves?”</p>
        <p>“Nothin’,” Gusterson said softly.
          “Nothin’ at all.”</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">He could feel</span> the disappointment
          well up in the
          room—and with it a touch of
          something like panic.</p>
        <p>This time Fay listened for
          quite a long while. “I hope you
          don’t mean that, Gussy,” he said
          at last very earnestly. “I mean,
          I hope you hunt deep and find
          some ideas you forgot, or maybe
          never realized you had at the
          time. Let me put it to you differently.
          What’s the place of ticklers
          in the natural scheme of
          things? What’s their aim in life?
          Their special reason? Their genius?
          Their final cause? What
          gods should ticklers worship?”</p>
        <p>But <ins title="Gunderson">Gusterson</ins> was already
          shaking his head. He said, “I
          don’t know anything about that
          at all.”</p>
        <p>Fay sighed and gave simultaneously
          with Pooh-Bah the
          now-familiar <ins title="triple-joined">triple-jointed</ins> shrug.
          Then the man briskened himself.
          “I guess that’s as far as we can
          get right now,” he said. “Keep
          thinking, Gussy. Try to remember
          something. You won’t be able
          <a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"></a>to leave your apartment—I’m
          setting guards. If you want to see
          me, tell them. Or just think—In due course you’ll be questioned
          further in any case. Perhaps
          by special methods. Perhaps
          you’ll be ticklerized. That’s all.
          Come on, everybody, let’s get going.”</p>
        <p>The pimply woman and her
          pal let go of Gusterson, Daisy’s
          man loosed his decorous hold,
          Davidson and Kester sidled away
          with an eye behind them and the
          little storm troop trudged out.</p>
        <p>Fay looked back in the doorway.
          “I’m sorry, Gussy,” he said
          and for a moment his old self
          looked out of his eyes. “I wish
          I could—” A claw reached for
          his ear, a spasm of pain crossed
          his face, he stiffened and marched
          off. The door shut.</p>
        <p>Gusterson took two deep
          breaths that were close to angry
          sobs. Then, still breathing stentorously,
          he stamped into the
          bedroom.</p>
        <p>“What—?” Daisy asked, looking
          after him.</p>
        <p>He came back carrying his .38
          and headed for the door.</p>
        <p>“What are you up to?” she demanded,
          knowing very well.</p>
        <p>“I’m going to blast that iron
          monkey off Fay’s back if it’s the
          last thing I do!”</p>
        <p>She threw her arms around
          him.</p>
        <p>“Now lemme go,” Gusterson
          growled. “I gotta be a man one
          time anyway.”</p>
        <p>As they struggled for the gun,
          the door opened noiselessly,
          Davidson slipped in and deftly
          snatched the weapon out of their
          hands before they realized he
          was there. He said nothing, only
          smiled at them and shook his
          head in sad reproof as he went
          out.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Gusterson</span> slumped. “I
          <em>knew</em> they were all psionic,”
          he said softly. “I just got out of
          control now—that last look Fay
          gave us.” He touched Daisy’s
          arm. “Thanks, kid.”</p>
        <p>He walked to the glass wall
          and looked out desultorily. After
          a while he turned and said,
          “Maybe you better be with the
          kids, hey? I imagine the guards’ll
          let you through.”</p>
        <p>Daisy shook her head. “The
          kids never come home until supper.
          For the next few hours
          they’ll be safer without me.”</p>
        <p>Gusterson nodded vaguely, sat
          down on the couch and propped
          his chin on the base of his palm.
          After a while his brow smoothed
          and Daisy knew that the wheels
          had started to turn inside and the
          electrons to jump around—except
          that she reminded herself to
          permanently cross out those particular
          figures of speech from her
          vocabulary.</p>
        <p>After about half an hour Gusterson
          <a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"></a>said softly, “I think the
          ticklers are so psionic that it’s as
          if they just had one mind. If I
          were with them very long I’d
          start to be part of that mind. Say
          something to one of them and
          you say it to all.”</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes later: “They’re
          not crazy, they’re just newborn.
          The ones that were creating a
          cootching chaos downstairs were
          like babies kickin’ their legs and
          wavin’ their eyes, tryin’ to see
          what their bodies could do. Too
          bad their bodies are us.”</p>
        <p>Ten minutes more: “I gotta do
          something about it. Fay’s right.
          It’s all my fault. He’s just the
          apprentice; I’m the old sorcerer
          himself.”</p>
        <p>Five minutes more, gloomily:
          “Maybe it’s man’s destiny to
          build live machines and then bow
          out of the cosmic picture. Except
          the ticklers need us, dammit, just
          like nomads need horses<ins title=",">.</ins>”</p>
        <p>Another five minutes: “Maybe
          somebody could dream up a purpose
          in life for ticklers. Even a
          religion—the First Church of
          Pooh-Bah Tickler. But I hate
          selling other people spiritual
          ideas and that’d still leave ticklers
          parasitic on humans….”</p>
        <p>As he murmured those last
          words Gusterson’s eyes got wide
          as a maniac’s and a big smile
          reached for his ears. He stood up
          and faced himself toward the
          door.</p>
        <p>“What are you intending to do
          now?” Daisy asked flatly.</p>
        <p>“I’m merely goin’ out an’ save
          the world,” he told her. “I may
          be back for supper and I may
          not.”</p>
        <h2>VIII</h2>
        <p><span class="first_word">Davidson</span> pushed out from
          the wall against which he’d
          been resting himself and his two-stone
          tickler and moved to block
          the hall. But Gusterson simply
          walked up to him. He shook his
          hand warmly and looked his tickler
          full in the eye and said in a
          ringing voice, “Ticklers should
          have bodies of their own!” He
          paused and then added casually,
          “Come on, let’s visit your boss.”</p>
        <p>Davidson listened for instructions
          and then nodded. But he
          watched Gusterson warily as
          they walked down the hall.</p>
        <p>In the elevator Gusterson repeated
          his message to the second
          guard, who turned out to be the
          pimply woman, now wearing
          shoes. This time he added, “Ticklers
          shouldn’t be tied to the frail
          bodies of humans, which need a
          lot of thoughtful supervision and
          drug-injecting and can’t even fly.”</p>
        <p>Crossing the park, Gusterson
          stopped a hump-backed soldier
          and informed him, “Ticklers gotta
          cut the apron string and snap
          the silver cord and go out in the
          universe and find their own purposes.”
          <a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"></a>Davidson and the pimply
          woman didn’t interfere. They
          merely waited and watched and
          then led Gusterson on.</p>
        <p>On the escaladder he told
          someone, “It’s cruel to tie ticklers
          to slow-witted snaily humans
          when ticklers can think and live
          … ten thousand times as fast,”
          he finished, plucking the figure
          from the murk of his unconscious.</p>
        <p>By the time they got to the
          bottom, the message had become,
          “Ticklers should have a planet of
          their own!”</p>
        <p>They never did catch up with
          Fay, although they spent two
          hours skimming around on slidewalks,
          under the subterranean
          stars, pursuing rumors of his
          presence. Clearly the boss tickler
          (which was how they thought
          of Pooh-bah) led an energetic
          life. Gusterson continued to deliver
          his message to all and sundry
          at 30-second intervals. Toward
          the end he found himself
          doing it in a dreamy and forgetful
          way. His mind, he decided,
          was becoming assimilated to the
          communal telepathic mind of the
          ticklers. It did not seem to matter
          at the time.</p>
        <p>After two hours Gusterson
          realized that he and his guides
          were becoming part of a general
          movement of people, a flow
          as mindless as that of blood corpuscles
          through the veins, yet at
          the same time dimly purposeful—at
          least there was the feeling
          that it was at the behest of a
          mind far above.</p>
        <p>The flow was topside. All the
          slidewalks seemed to lead to the
          concourses and the escaladders.
          Gusterson found himself part of
          a human stream moving into the
          tickler factory adjacent to his
          apartment—or another factory
          very much like it.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Thereafter</span> Gusterson’s awarenesses
          were dimmed. It
          was as if a bigger mind were doing
          the remembering for him and
          it were permissible and even
          mandatory for him to dream his
          way along. He knew vaguely that
          days were passing. He knew he
          had work of a sort: at one time
          he was bringing food to gaunt-eyed
          tickler-mounted humans
          working feverishly in a production
          line—human hands and
          tickler claws working together in
          a blur of rapidity on silvery
          mechanisms that moved along
          jumpily on a great belt; at another
          he was sweeping piles of
          metal scraps and garbage down
          a gray corridor.</p>
        <p>Two scenes stood out a little
          more vividly.</p>
        <p>A windowless wall had been
          knocked out for twenty feet.
          There was blue sky outside, its
          light almost hurtful, and a drop
          of many stories. A file of humans
          were being processed. When one
          <a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"></a>of them got to the head of the
          file his (or her) tickler was ceremoniously
          unstrapped from his
          shoulder and welded onto a silvery
          cask with smoothly pointed
          ends. The result was something
          that looked—at least in the case
          of the Mark 6 ticklers—like a
          stubby silver submarine, child
          size. It would hum gently, lift
          off the floor and then fly slowly
          out through the big blue gap.
          Then the next tickler-ridden human
          would step forward for processing.</p>
        <p>The second scene was in a
          park, the sky again blue, but big
          and high with an argosy of white
          clouds. Gusterson was lined up in
          a crowd of humans that stretched
          as far as he could see, row on
          irregular row. Martial music was
          playing. Overhead hovered a
          flock of little silver submarines,
          lined up rather more orderly in
          the air than the humans were on
          the ground. The music rose to a
          heart-quickening climax. The
          tickler nearest Gusterson gave
          (as if to say, “And now—who
          knows?”) a triple-jointed shrug
          that stung his memory. Then the
          ticklers took off straight up on
          their new and shining bodies.
          They became a flight of silver
          geese … of silver midges …
          and the humans around Gusterson
          lifted a ragged cheer….</p>
        <p>That scene marked the beginning
          of the return of Gusterson’s
          mind and memory. He shuffled
          around for a bit, spoke vaguely
          to three or four people he recalled
          from the dream days, and
          then headed for home and supper—three
          weeks late, and as
          disoriented and emaciated as a
          bear coming out of hibernation.</p>
        <p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">Six months</span> later Fay was
          having dinner with Daisy
          and Gusterson. The cocktails had
          been poured and the children
          were playing in the next apartment.
          The transparent violet
          walls brightened, then gloomed,
          as the sun dipped below the horizon.</p>
        <p>Gusterson said, “I see where a
          spaceship out beyond the orbit
          of Mars was holed by a tickler.
          I wonder where the little guys
          are headed now?”</p>
        <p>Fay started to give a writhing
          left-armed shrug, but stopped
          himself with a grimace.</p>
        <p>“Maybe out of the solar system
          altogether,” suggested Daisy,
          who’d recently dyed her hair fire-engine
          red and was wearing red
          leotards.</p>
        <p>“They got a weary trip ahead
          of them,” Gusterson said, “unless
          they work out a hyper-Einsteinian
          drive on the way.”</p>
        <p>Fay grimaced again. He was
          still looking rather peaked. He
          said plaintively, “Haven’t we
          heard enough about ticklers for
          a while?”</p>
        <p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"></a>“I guess so,” Gusterson agreed,
          “but I get to wondering about the
          little guys. They were so serious
          and intense about everything. I
          never did solve their problem,
          you know. I just shifted it onto
          other shoulders than ours. No
          joke intended,” he hurried to add.</p>
        <p>Fay forbore to comment. “By
          the way, Gussy,” he said, “have
          you heard anything from the Red
          Cross about that world-saving
          medal I nominated you for? I
          know you think the whole concept
          of world-saving medals is
          ridiculous, especially when they
          started giving them to all heads
          of state who didn’t start atomic
          wars while in office, but—”</p>
        <p>“Nary a peep,” Gusterson told
          him. “I’m not proud, Fay. I could
          use a few world-savin’ medals.
          I’d start a flurry in the old-gold
          market. But I don’t worry about
          those things. I don’t have time to.
          I’m busy these days thinkin’ up
          a bunch of new inventions.”</p>
        <p>“Gussy!” Fay said sharply, his
          face tightening in alarm, “Have
          you forgotten your promise?”</p>
        <p>“’Course not, Fay. My new inventions
          aren’t for Micro or any
          other firm. They’re just a legitimate
          part of my literary endeavors.
          Happens my next insanity
          novel is goin’ to be about
          a mad inventor.”</p>
